MESSAGE FROM  THE PARTY 
PRESIDENT 
Fellow Ugandans, 
Uganda has endured a turbulent political history  defined by unfulfilled promises, corruption, division,  and abuse of power. For nearly four decades, our  people have been subjected to poverty, injustice,  and despair under a regime that has overstayed  its welcome. Successive governments have failed  to unite our people, respect our freedoms, and  guarantee equal opportunities for all. 
Yet, amidst this pain, Uganda remains a nation  of hope. We are blessed with vast resources,  fertile land, a vibrant youth population, and an  ambitious diaspora community. What we lack is  not potential—it is leadership that listens, acts, and  serves. 
The National Unity Platform (NUP) has therefore  come forward with this Manifesto as a bold  declaration of intent to build A New Uganda Now—a  Uganda where every citizen is treated equally,  dreams are nurtured, and a solid foundation is laid  for future generations. This Manifesto is not just a  document; it is a covenant between us and the 48  million Ugandans yearning for freedom, dignity,  and prosperity. 
Our commitment is clear: we will reset Uganda by  restoring democracy, ending corruption, healing  
For God and My Country. 
  

divisions, and guaranteeing equal access to  opportunities. We will create jobs for our young  people, feed our children in schools, stop land  grabbing, and ensure that every Ugandan has  access to quality healthcare, education, and  infrastructure. We will place the diaspora at  the center of our development, empower local  governments, and transform Uganda into a  modern, technology-driven economy. 
This election is not about me. It is about us. It is  about building a country that works for everyone— not just a privileged few. It is about reclaiming the  dream of 1962 and delivering it to a new generation. 
The time has come to break the cycle of betrayal  and chart a new path. Let us rise together and  declare with one voice: “People Power—Our Power,  Our Power— People Power.” 
The choice before us is simple: to continue in  poverty, corruption, and dictatorship, or to stand  boldly for A New Uganda Now. Not tomorrow. Not  later. The time is NOW. 
I invite you all—men and women, young and old,  rural and urban, at home and in the diaspora—to  join us in this struggle for transformation. Together,  we shall win, and together, we shall build a free, just,  and prosperous Uganda. 
Hon.Kyagulanyi Ssentamu Robert— BOBI WINE Party President & Presidential Candidate, 2026

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The National Unity Platform (NUP) presents this  Manifesto as a bold declaration of intent to build  A New Uganda Now—a Uganda that treats all  citizens equally, nurtures dreams, and lays a solid  foundation for future generations. This is not just a  policy document; it is our solemn contract with the  people of Uganda. 
This document serves as the blueprint for the work  we will undertake upon receiving the mandate  in January 2026. It marks a decisive step toward  restoring hope for over 48 million Ugandans who, for  nearly four decades under Gen. Yoweri Museveni’s  rule, have endured contested elections, gross  human rights abuses, corruption, unlawful arrests,  disappearances, and the erosion of democratic  principles. 
Why A New Uganda Now? 
Uganda’s history reflects a cycle of hope and  betrayal. At independence in 1962, Ugandans  dreamed of unity, self-determination, and prosperity.  Those hopes were derailed by years of instability,  and although Museveni’s regime entered in 1986  as a promise of redemption, today our people face  despair: 
1. Poverty & Hunger: Over 7.3 million Ugandans  live below the poverty line (UNHS 2023/24),  with rural areas most affected. Despite 80% of  Uganda’s land being arable able to feed over  200 million people annually, food insecurity  affects the majority (57%) of Ugandans mostly  in rural communities (NPHC 2024). 
2. Youth Unemployment: Over 75% of Ugandans  are under 30, yet half of them (50.9%) are not  in education, employment, or training (NPHC  2024). 
3. Healthcare Gaps: Uganda’s healthcare system  is wanting with 82 districts lack a fully equipped  general hospital; 78% of sub-counties lack a  Health Centre III. Uganda’s Human Capital  
NATIONAL UNITY PLATFORM | 2026
Index stands at just 0.39 meaning that under  current health and education conditions, the  average child will be only 39% as productive as  they could be with full access to quality services. 
4. Infrastructure Deficit: Only 3.9% of Uganda’s  159,364 km road network is paved. Kampala, the  economic heart, has just 29% tarmacked roads,  most in poor condition. 
5. Debt & Corruption: The total stock of public debt  was Shs116.21 trillion (51.3% of GDP) by June 2025  up from Shs94.72 trillion as at the end of June  2024. This implies that to-date our per-capita  debt stands at shs3 million, while corruption  drains over Shs10 trillion annually. 
6. Dictatorship & Civic Space: The Constitution  has been manipulated to entrench Museveni’s  longer stay in power raising from the original 216  to 295 articles as of January 2021; Parliament  and Judiciary are compromised; civil society  and media freedoms are shrinking. Evidence  from the World Justice Project’s 2024 Rule of  Law Index, indicate that Uganda ranked 126th  out of 142 countries scoring just 0.39, reflecting  serious deficits in legal integrity, fundamental  rights, and government accountability. The  sharp closure and ban of majority (57.1%) of the  operations of the registered NGOs in Uganda  towards the 2021 general elections—from  over 14,000 in 2019 to around 6,000 today— underscores a broader trend of regulatory  crackdowns and waning donor confidence in  Uganda’s civic environment. 
7. Land Insecurity: Only 30.7% of adults have  secure land tenure, undermining food security  and wealth creation (NPHC 2024). 
8. Ethnic Imbalance & Nepotism: Recruitment  in public service is riddled with favoritism,  undermining national unity and efficiency.  A mini-survey of the 425 top government  appointments to determine the level of ethnic  
iv 
MANIFESTO 
balance in government institutions and  bodies by the independent paper revealed  that Ugandans from the west hold 181 top  government jobs almost double what their  colleagues from the central hold (107), leaving  only 68 and 69 jobs for those from the north  and east respectively. Evidence by the Equal  opportunities commission (EOC) report of  FY2022/23 reveals that western Uganda  accounts for 40% of top positions in government  agencies, the central (26%), eastern (20%) and  northern (12%). Specifically, when it comes to  chief executive officers-those who make final  decisions in government agencies, western  Uganda takes up unmatched 47percent. The  northern (20%), central (18%), and eastern (15%)  regions all find themselves playing catch-up. 
9. Unhealed Post-war Wounds: Millions of  victims of conflict remain uncompensated,  unreconciled, and unheard. Evidence from the  study by Center for civil and human rights at the  University of Notre Dame revealed that majority  (83.76%) of Victims of violence/armed conflicts  in the affected parts of Uganda have not been  adequately compensated for their suffering;  majority (94.15%) of families/relatives of family  members, or close friends have not received  fair payment from the NRM government for  their suffering; majority ( 77.9%) of the Leaders  of organized armed groups that were involved  in violence in affected parts of the country have  not adequately apologized for wrongs they  committed and majority (68.11%) of perpetrators  of violence in these affected places of the  country have not been held accountable for  their crimes. 
10. Diaspora Neglect: Uganda’s diaspora community  now exceeds 2 million people and remitted over  USD 1.569 billion in FY2024/25 up from USD 1.403  billion in FY2023/24, representing the single largest  source of foreign exchange and approximately  3% of GDP. Beyond financial remittances, the  diaspora fuels entrepreneurship, foreign direct  investment, skills transfer, and global advocacy.  Yet, despite its enormous potential, the diaspora  remains largely underutilized due to institutional  neglect, weak policy frameworks, and an  
v
adversarial political environment. 
Despite these challenges, Uganda remains a nation  of young, ambitious people and abundant resources.  Progress is possible—but only with leadership that  listens, acts, and serves all Ugandans. 
Our Commitment: A Complete Reset 
This manifesto is not just a critique of failure; it is a  roadmap to reclaim our future. 
NUP’s leadership is ready and committed to  delivering a Uganda that works for everyone, not  just a privileged few. 
Our First Eleven Policy Priorities (2026 and  beyond): 
1. Restore freedom, constitutionalism, and human  rights (including gender equity). 
2. End corruption and wasteful government  expenditure. 
3. Consolidate national unity, rebuild war-torn  communities, and eliminate sectarianism. 
4. Guarantee equal access to quality public  services—clean water, healthcare, education,  energy, and public infrastructure. 
5. Create 10 million new jobs by 2032, on account  of lowering the cost of doing business as well as  leveraging tourism, manufacturing, sports, and  the creative economy. 
6. Establish a public-school feeding program to  transform agriculture, ensure food security,  enhance education outcomes and support a  heathy population. 
7. Stop land grabbing and guarantee secure land  rights for all. 
8. Empower regional and local governance  through real devolution. 
9. Position the diaspora as a strategic asset  and strengthen foreign policy for Uganda’s  development and global competitiveness. 
10. Ensure sustainable management of natural  resources and climate resilience [including  Climate Change detection, adaptation and  mitigation]. 
11. Transform Uganda into a tech-driven economy  through leveraging technology resources and  innovation. 
The first 6 are considered as high impact high  frequency indicators and the last 5 are High  impact Low frequency indicators. These are the  indicators that Ugandans will use to measure NUP  administration impact over the manifesto period.  The first top 6 policy priorities are carefully selected  to confront Uganda’s most pressing challenges,  and the bottom 5 are selected to unlock the vast  potential of our people and resources, and lay the  groundwork for a sustainable future where every  Ugandan at home and abroad can thrive. Together,  these priorities form the backbone of NUP’s  transformation agenda—bold, people-centered,  and urgently needed. 
Our Call: 
Let us build

RESTORE FREEDOM,  CONSTITUTIONALISM,  AND HUMAN RIGHTS  (INCLUDING GENDER  EQUITY). 
INTRODUCTION: 
“Being democratic is not enough,  a majority cannot turn what is  wrong into right— In order to be  considered truly free, countries  must also have a deep love of  liberty and an abiding respect  for the rule of law.” ~ Margaret  Thatcher. A picture currently  portrayed in the 11th Parliament  of Uganda. 
Uganda’s Democratic  Decline 
Uganda’s democracy is facing  a severe decline, driven largely  by Gen. Yoweri Museveni’s  prolonged rule of nearly four  decades. Since taking power  militarily in 1986, Museveni has  progressively consolidated  power, undermining political  pluralism, civic freedoms,  and institutional checks and  balances. 
The 2024  
Bertelsmann  
Transformation  Index (BTI)  
classifies Uganda  as a defective  democracy,  
citing the erosion  of democratic  institutions,  
suppression of  dissent, and  
weakening of the  rule of law. 
Key constitutional safeguards  have been systematically  dismantled: The 1995  Constitution, which once  symbolized Uganda’s rule of law,  has been repeatedly violated;  the intention (with which it was  made) has been dropped. It is  not what it was. It has been re purposed to serve the interests  of Gen.Museveni and his family  against the interests of the rest  of 48 million Ugandans. During  the 29 years of the life of the  October 8th 1995 Constitution of  Uganda, a number of key and  pro-people articles have been  deleted completely and some  amended in favour of the NRM  regime- rising from the original  216 to 295 articles [as of January  2021]. Pertinent articles—  originally intended to regulate  presidential terms and age  limits—have been deleted. The  removal of term limits in 2005  and the age limit in 2017 paved  the way for Gen. Museveni to run  for indefinite re-election, despite  strong public rejection.

MANIFESTO 
  

A nationwide survey conducted  by the Citizens’ Coalition for  Electoral Democracy in Uganda  (CCEDU) and the Uganda  Governance Monitoring Platform  (UGMP) in 2017 before these  amendments found that 85% of  the 48million Ugandans opposed  the removal of term and age  limits. Despite this, Parliament  passed the amendments,  reflecting a growing disregard  for popular will. Additionally,  on May 20th 2025, Parliament  passed the controversial UPDF  (Amendment) Bill 2025, granting  military courts powers to try  civilians, a move that defied the  supreme court ruling of January  31, 2025. Court ruled that it was  not constitutional for civilians  to be tried in Military courts but  parliament with influence from  Gen.Museveni passed the bill into  law and later consented by Gen. Museveni, despite Article 92 of  the Constitution, which prohibits  Parliament from enacting laws  that overturn specific court  decisions.

Erosion of the Rule of Law   
Uganda ranked  126th out of 142  countries in the  World Justice  
Project’s 2024  
Rule of Law  
Index, scoring just  0.39, reflecting  
serious deficits  
in legal integrity,  fundamental rights,  and government  accountability. 
State institutions—particularly  the Judiciary, Parliament,  and Electoral Commission— have lost their independence,  and Museveni’s authoritarian  practices increasingly define the  governance of these institutions.  The use of security forces to stifle  
dissent has intensified, often  
disappearance,  
NATIONAL UNITY PLATFORM | 2026 ongoing detention has been  
in violation of constitutional  protections. 
In November 2024, opposition  figure Dr. Kizza Besigye was  abducted in Nairobi, forcibly  transferred to Uganda, and  arraigned before a military court  on charges of treachery and  illegal possession of firearms— 
despite a January 2025 Supreme  Court ruling affirming that  civilians cannot be tried in  military courts. His ongoing  detention, amid deteriorating  health, has drawn criticism from  human rights organizations. 
Similarly, in January 2025, human  rights lawyer Eron Kiiza was  sentenced by a military court— without access to a civilian  trial—for “contempt of court,”  raising further concerns about  the abuse of military justice  mechanisms. 
Members of the opposition  National Unity Platform (NUP)  continue to face arbitrary arrest  and detention. On April 27,  2025, Edward Ssebufu (Eddie  Mutwe), Head of Security for  NUP President Robert Kyagulanyi  (Bobi Wine), was abducted  in Mukono District and held  incommunicado for several days.  Gen. Muhoozi Kainerugaba,  Commander of the UPDF and  son of the Gen.Museveni, later  publicly claimed responsibility for  his detention in the basement at  his home. 
Such acts  
of enforced  
torture, and the use  of military courts  to try civilians  
represent a direct  assault on Uganda’s  constitutional order. 
Due Process and the Legal  Environment 
Article 28(1) of the 1995  Constitution guarantees the  right to a fair, speedy, and public  hearing before an independent  and impartial court. However,  the increased use of the General  Court Martial to prosecute  civilians—especially political  opponents—violates this  fundamental right. 
Although Section 119(1)(h)(i)  of the UPDF Act, 2005 allows  military courts to try civilians  found in possession of military  equipment, the provision has  been widely misused to target  opposition supporters especially  during election season. 
A notable case is the December  30, 2020 arrest of 49 NUP  supporters in Kalangala District  during campaign event ahead of  2021 presidential general election.  They were initially charged in the  Masaka Chief Magistrate’s Court  with incitement to violence and  COVID-19-related offences. After  being granted bail, they were  immediately rearrested and  charged by the General Court  Martial with unlawful possession  of ammunition—despite a  lack of credible evidence. Their  
widely condemned as a breach  of due process. 
Although the Supreme Court in  Uganda Law Society v. Attorney  General (2006) questioned the  trial of civilians in military courts,  Parliament has since amended  the UPDF Act to entrench  the military’s authority to try  civilians— further weakening  judicial independence and  undermining the rule of law. 
Human Rights 
Human rights are the foundation  of any society committed to the  rule of law, good governance,  and democracy. These rights  are universal, inalienable,  and essential for protecting  individuals from political, legal,  and social injustices. 
Uganda is a  
signatory to key  international human  rights instruments,  including the  
Universal  
Declaration of  
Human Rights,  
which declares in  Articles 1 and 2 that  “All human beings  are born free and  equal in dignity and  rights,” and that  “everyone is entitled  
4
MANIFESTO 
to all the rights and  freedoms set forth  in this Declaration.”  
Domestically, Chapter Four of  the 1995 Constitution enshrines  fundamental rights and  freedoms, obligating the State to  respect, protect, and fulfil these  rights for all citizens. 
Uganda has, however,  increasingly witnessed a  disturbing pattern of human  rights violations under  Museveni’s rule. These include  restrictions on freedoms of  assembly, association, and  expression, arbitrary arrests of  opposition leaders, the targeting  of independent media, and the  unjustified suppression of online  activity—particularly through  repeated internet shutdowns  and censorship during critical  political moments. 
Such actions, combined with  the NRM government’s failure to  ensure accountability for past  abuses, have eroded public trust  and undermined democratic  participation, especially in the  aftermath of the 2021 general  elections. 
Media Freedoms and  Broader Human Rights  Violations 
A free, independent, and vibrant  media is the cornerstone of  democratic governance, civic  engagement, and accountability.  Uganda’s Constitution affirms  this principle. Article 29(a)  guarantees freedom of speech  and expression, including  freedom of the press and other  
5
media, while Article 41(1) affirms  every citizen’s right to access  information held by the State,  except under narrowly defined  security or privacy exceptions. 
Yet, under the current NRM/NRA  regime, these rights have been  systematically undermined.  Media freedoms in Uganda are  under sustained attack through  legal, physical, and digital  means: 
Laws such as the Press and  Journalist Act of 2000, originally  meant to professionalize  journalism, have been weaponized  to restrict who qualifies as a  journalist, criminalize independent  reporting, and control media  content. 
Broadcasting licenses have  been arbitrarily revoked, and  journalists face harassment,  assault, detention, and even  torture while covering political  events—particularly opposition  campaign activities. 
Social media shutdowns,  most notably in January 2021  ahead of the general elections,  were ordered by the Uganda  Communications Commission  on the Gen.Museveni’s directive  following Facebook’s closure of  NRM-linked accounts. Platforms  including Facebook, WhatsApp,  Twitter, and Viber were blocked  nationwide, severely curtailing  citizens’ access to information  during a critical electoral period. 
Violent suppression of  media professionals has  become disturbingly  
normalized: 
On February 17, 2021, more than  20 journalists were brutally  assaulted by military and police  officers while covering President  Robert Kyagulanyi’s attempt  to deliver a petition to the  United Nations Human Rights  Office in Kololo, Kampala. More  recently, journalists covering  the Kawempe North by-election  2025 were similarly beaten  by army personnel. These  incidents reflect a persistent and  systematic pattern of media  repression in Uganda. To date,  no perpetrators have been held  accountable, and a climate of  impunity continues to prevail. 
Such actions violate both the  Ugandan Constitution and  international human rights  obligations, including the  International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights (ICCPR),  which permits restrictions on  free speech only under narrowly  defined, lawful, necessary,  and proportionate conditions.  Uganda’s current actions fail to  meet these standards. 
Other Abuses of Human  Rights 
The abuse of media freedom  is part of a broader assault on  fundamental human rights in  Uganda: 
Freedom of assembly and  association has been eroded  through arbitrary bans on peaceful  protests, especially by opposition  parties and civil society groups. 
Political opponents and activists  are frequently subjected to  abduction, illegal detention, and  torture, often without trial or legal  representation. 
Digital surveillance and  censorship have expanded, with  
national progress. 
NATIONAL UNITY PLATFORM | 2026 
governments targeting implicated  Ugandan officials. 
authorities using cyber laws  to intimidate and criminalize  dissent online. 
Access to justice is routinely  denied, particularly for victims of  state violence, as courts remain  heavily influenced by the regime. 
Corruption 
Corruption remains  one of the most  corrosive forces  undermining  
Uganda’s  
governance,  
development, and  public trust. It is  deeply entrenched  across all levels of  society, particularly  within the state  apparatus, where  it has fuelled  
inefficiency,  
mismanagement  of resources, and  eroded institutional  integrity. 
Despite the existence of a  robust legal and institutional  anti-corruption framework the  gap between anti-corruption  rhetoric and actual enforcement  has widened, fuelling public  disillusionment and obstructing  
Uganda loses an estimated UGX  10 trillion (approximately USD 2.7  billion) to corruption annually  (IGG report, 2022)—equivalent  to the budget allocated for key  services such as education,  health and water combined  in financial year 2024/25. This  massive haemorrhage of public  funds severely undermines  service delivery, delays critical  infrastructure projects, and  worsens poverty levels. 
Key structural and political  drivers behind this persistent  corruption crisis include: 
Lack of genuine political  will, evidenced by selective  prosecutions and the shielding of  politically connected individuals; 
Weak and under-resourced  anti-corruption institutions,  often lacking independence  and saddled with overlapping  mandates; 
Over centralization of power,  particularly within the presidency,  which dilutes accountability and  subverts constitutional checks; 
A political economy dependent  on corruption, sustaining a cycle  of impunity and normalizing  theft of public resources. 
High-profile scandals—such  as the #ParliamentExhibition  revelations and the iron sheets  scandal involving the Office of the  Prime Minister—have laid bare the  impunity with which public officials  operate. These cases have sparked  public outrage and attracted  international condemnation,  including sanctions from foreign  
Uganda is ranked 140th out of  180 countries in Transparency  International’s 2024 Corruption  Perceptions Index, with a score  of 26 out of 100—well below the  global average of 43. This reflects  the country’s deteriorating  governance environment and  persistent failure to curb high level corruption. 
The impact of corruption is  devastating and far-reaching: 
It deprives citizens of access to  quality healthcare, education,  and public safety; 
It undermines investor  confidence, stifles  entrepreneurship, and degrades  the business environment; 
It deepens inequality, erodes  democratic institutions, and  feeds political discontent and  instability; 
It weakens tax morale, as citizens  become less willing to contribute  to a state perceived as predatory  and self-serving. 
Ultimately, corruption is not  just a governance issue—it is  a national security threat. It  perpetuates poverty, fosters  inequality, and locks Uganda in  a cycle 
of underdevelopment. Without  bold political reform and  meaningful enforcement of  anti-corruption laws, Uganda  will continue to rank among the  world’s poorest nations, despite  its potential.

MANIFESTO 
Conclusion 
The endemic corruption, the  systematic erosion of democratic  institutions, the abuse of military  courts, the suppression of  the media, and the persistent  violation of fundamental human  rights reflect a regime solely  committed to clinging to power.  As the rule of law collapses  under the weight of impunity,  Uganda’s future is held hostage  by authoritarianism. This state  of affairs must not only be  resisted—but decisively rejected.

EXPENDITURE. 
INTRODUCTION 
Uganda is currently facing  a serious breakdown in her  fiscal discipline, marked by  unchecked supplementary  budgets, excessive borrowing,  extravagant spending, and  chronic underfunding of  essential social services such as  health, education, and water  and sanitation. These practices  undermine the credibility of  the national budget, weaken  long-term planning, and create  dangerous fiscal imbalances  that threaten our country’s  economic stability and social  development. 
SITUATION  
ANALYSIS 
Millions of Ugandans are stack  in absolute poverty amidst the  wasteful expenditures, growing  appetite for corruption and  skyrocketing debt. According to  the Uganda National Household  
Survey 2023/24, more than 7.3  million Ugandans—nearly one  in six citizens—live below the  absolute poverty line, defined as  earning less than $1 or Shs3,663  per day, per person. Put this in  perspective, if somehow one is  considered to be at Shs4,000/=  per day, per person, that one is  not included in the statistic! Think  about this and consider that in  real terms, 60%+ of the population  may in fact be in real poverty  and growing … considering the  birth rate of Uganda and the  factors of disparity including  corruption. Now, Shs3,663/= per  day, per person, means about  Shs100,000/= for a full 30-day  month. Try to ration this average  for: –Rent (shelter), Food (feeding),  Transportation (commuting),  Medical (healthcare) and  Education (including skilling).  No wonder millions of our youth  have moved to middle east to  find a way out. 
Wasteful Government  Expenditure 
The wastefulness begins with  the office of president and his  residence. Gen. Museveni and  his family continues to enjoy  presidential privilege since he  ascended to power 40 years ago  after leading a coup against  Uganda’s former ruler. It is only  in Uganda where Museveni has  more cars than ambulances  attached to public hospitals.  Gen. Museveni has over 600  vehicles at his disposal yet the  total number of ambulances in  public facilities is about 178. You  cannot justify Gen.Museveni is  keeping 400 vehicles under his  office and 266 vehicles at his  residence (State House). Notably,  71 of these are dedicated solely to  Museveni’s convoy for domestic  travel raising from grew from 33  in in FY2018/19.

the 10th Parliament, with several  having served more than two  terms. This unchecked spending  continues to erode the majority  of Ugandans critical life servers. 
Moreover, while wasteful  spending soars, the health sector  remains under-resourced: 82  districts still lack a fully equipped  public general hospital. This  glaring disconnect between  budget allocations and on-the 
While the State House policy  statement provides a cost range  for these vehicles—between  Shs150 billion and Shs500  million—the actual costs of the  president’s personal vehicles  remain undisclosed. Moreover,  annual expenses on vehicle  maintenance are about (-+)  Shs7.2billion annually, while  fuel costs—subsumed under  inland travel expenses—total  Shs80 billion each year. Gen.  Muhoozi Kainerugaba, the son  to Museveni maintains a fleet  of nearly a dozen vehicles,  complete with amenities akin  to those of his father’s convoy.  Janet Museveni, the Museveni’s  wife, also has her own convoy  with similar facilities. This isn’t  the representation of leaders  governing an economically  challenged country reliant  on unpayable loans; rather, it  resembles the grandiosity of  kings, queens, and royalty. 
Museveni’s staff roster includes 82  presidential advisors, 142 resident  district commissioners (RDCs), 98  deputy RDCs, about 89 assistant  RDCs, 27 senior presidential  assistants, 40 private secretaries,  a substantial workforce of 761  staff at the office of presidency,  and a domestic staff of 996 at his  
11
residence alone—comprising 59  waitresses, 14 room attendants,  80 gardeners, 129 drivers, 50  cleaners, 35 cooks, and 12 chefs,  among others. This extensive  payroll incurs a staggering annual  cost of approximately Shs50  billion. Furthermore, Museveni’s  office of the president employs  an additional 761 individuals.  Moreover, there is an apparent  lack of clear guidelines for their  recruitment, qualifications, and  remuneration. In addition to  these, we continue to remunerate  former prime ministers as  presidential advisors. Such  spending if left unchecked it will  deny the majority of Ugandans  the basic necessities such has  education, health, safe & clean  water, and social protection. 
With 529 MPs, our parliament is  excessively large. Uganda ranks  among the highest in legislator  pay in Africa, surpassed mainly  by South Africa. Every five years,  Members of Parliament receive  a car allowance—regardless  of whether they are newly  elected or returning. This means  that re-elected MPs continue  to receive funds for the same  entitlement. For instance, the  11th Parliament includes 181  members who returned from  
ground need underscores a  misalignment of priorities by the  NRM government. 
National Debt 
Uganda’s rising public debt and the  growing burden of debt servicing  continue to raise serious concerns  about fiscal sustainability. Interest  payments alone are projected to  reach approximately UGX 9.24  trillion in FY2025/26, consuming  over 25% of domestic revenue. This  level of debt service significantly  constrains the government’s  ability to invest in essential sectors  such as health, education, and  infrastructure. 
Our total debt (external and  domestic) as of March 2023 was  Shs85.2 trillion exceeding that  year’s total budget of Shs52.7  trillion, according to the Bank of  Uganda State of the Economy  April 2023 Report exceeding the  pre-pandemic levels tracked at  34.6% of GDP. By FY2021/22, it  had risen above 50%, breaching  the IMF’s 50% threshold for  low-income countries—a  warning sign of increasing debt  vulnerability. As of June 2023,  Uganda’s public debt reached  Shs96.1 trillion (about USD 25.3  billion), equivalent to roughly  52% of GDP. Of this, shs.44.6  
NATIONAL UNITY PLATFORM | 2026 
trillion was domestic debt, while  Shs.51.5 trillion was external. 
According to the  Bank of Uganda,  debt servicing  
accounted for  
about 35% of  
domestic revenue  in FY2024/25,  
meaning that Shs35  out of every Shs100  collected in revenue  
went toward debt  repayment. This  trend, if unchecked,  could push Uganda  toward debt distress  and increase the  risk of default. 
Today, the NRM government is  celebrating the Shs.226.3trillion  economy BUT however more  than 54% of this celebration  is in debt. This implies that to 
date per capita debt stands  at about shs3.5million. In the  current financial year 2025/26,  the NRM government plans to  collect shs37.2 trillion in domestic  revenues out of the shs72.3trillion  nation budget. This suggests  that the rest (more than 50%)  of the budget will be financed  through borrowing. 
The decline in external aid  and development support— especially following increased  restrictions on civil society and  
the suspension of over 9,000  NGOs in recent years—has  deepened reliance on borrowing.  The NRM government continues  to acquire non-concessional  loans to meet recurrent  expenditures, reinforcing a cycle  of debt rollover and rising fiscal  pressure. 
If this trajectory persists, Uganda  risks falling into a “public debt  safety trap,” where deceptive  indicators mask deepening  financial instability. High debt  servicing crowds out investment  in critical sectors, undermines  economic growth, and  worsens inequalities—ultimately  threatening Uganda’s long term development and social  cohesion. 
Corruption continues to distort  public administration, with  estimates indicating over Shs.10  trillion annually (an amount  equivalent to the money needed  to constructing and retooling  82 districts in Uganda without  a single public general hospital;  1,112 parishes without a public  primary school and 115 sub  counties without substantial  public secondary schools)  lost due to administrative  inefficiencies and graft. The  current situation continues to  live approximately 15,400,000  Ugandans (about 3% of the  population) in extreme poverty  [these ones continue to live  below 1dollor a day]. 
National Budget 
Over the past decade, the cost of  public administration has surged  sharply without a corresponding  increase in domestic revenue,  
shrinking the fiscal space  available for development.  This has crowded out essential  development 
projects, whose funding has  significantly declined. The  high costs of managing  the public sector—coupled  with poor coordination and  administration— undermine  effective implementation of vital  development initiatives. 
Budget credibility has eroded  due to excessive reliance on  supplementary budgets. These  rose from 6.7% of total expenditure  in FY2017/18 to 9.7% in FY2021/22,  far exceeding the internationally  accepted 3% threshold. 
Debt servicing now consumes  over half (57%) of the national  budget, totaling UGX 41.7 trillion  in FY 2024/25. This amount even  exceeds anticipated domestic  revenue (UGX 32.3 trillion),  meaning all domestic revenue  is diverted to debt repayment.  Uganda spends roughly  UGX 114 billion daily servicing  debt—more than combined  budgets for health, education,  and social protection. 
The FY 2025/26  budget for key  
services such  
as education,  
health and water  combined is  
UGX 11.44trillion  out of the 72.3

MANIFESTO 
trillion national  
budget highlight a  slight increase from  UGX 10.204 trillion  in FY 2024/25— raising serious  
concerns about the  NRM government’s  capacity to save  the lives of the 48  million Ugandans. 
This contraction in fiscal space  stems from lower external  aid, a deliberate cutback in  domestic borrowing, reduced  inflows from the Petroleum Fund,  and scaled-back refinancing.  Meanwhile, statutory  obligations—particularly debt  servicing and interest—now  absorb an increasing share,  shrinking the discretionary  budget from UGX 28.1 trillion to  UGX 24.2 trillion. 
Sectoral allocations in FY 2025/26  further expose a disconnect  between ambition and funding.  Although the Ten Fold Growth  Strategy targets agro-industry,  tourism, minerals, oil, science,  and technology, these sectors  are only allocated around  UGX 2.67 trillion, far short of the  UGX 4.7 trillion earmarked in NDP  IV— raising serious concerns  about the NRM government’s  capacity to deliver its ambitious  development agenda. 
Domestic Revenue  
Generation 
In FY 2024/25, the government  collected UGX 27.7 trillion  
13
in domestic revenue— significantly below the projected  UGX 32.3 trillion, leaving a  financing gap of UGX 39.7 trillion  needed to support a  UGX 72 trillion budget. This  uncovered deficit accounted  for 55% of total expenditure,  meaning that only 45% of the  budget was funded through  domestic resources—a level  insufficient to meet Uganda’s  development goals. 
Yet, the previous FY 2024/25  budget revealed about  UGX 2.27 trillion in wasteful  expenditure, including: 
• Special meals and drinks -  UGX 300 billion  
• Welfare and entertainment -  UGX 136 billion 
• Workshops, seminars  & meetings -  
UGX 237 billion 
• Travel (inland & abroad) -  UGX 761 billion 
• Advertising &  
public relations -  
UGX 79 billion 
• Light vehicle acquisition -  UGX 56 billion 
• Recruitment expenses - UGX 13 billion 
• Postage & courier services -  UGX 2.8 billion 
Together, these items accounted  for approximately Shs2 trillion— far greater than Shs872.57 billion  allocated to Water, Sanitation,  Environmental Protection, and  social protection combined in  that financial year. These funds  would be better redirected  toward essential services. 
For the Financial year ending  June 2025, revenue collection  is projected at Shs31.9 trillion,  representing approximately  14.3% of GDP. This remains  well below the internationally  recognized benchmark of 30%  tax-to-GDP needed to achieve  sustainable development. 
Emerging and low-income  economies like Uganda typically  have an untapped tax potential  of 8–9% of GDP, according to  the IMF. Tapping into this could  provide more resources for public  investment and strengthen  private sector growth. 
Mineral & Natural Resource  Revenue Potential 
Uganda is richly endowed with  diverse mineral resources—such  as iron ore, limestone, gold, rare  earth elements (REEs), graphite,  cobalt, and copper— found  across multiple regions of the  country. These minerals hold  significant promise for fiscal  revenue generation, technology  transfer, and job creation. 
The Extractive Industries  Transparency Initiative (EITI)  
2021/22 report indicates that  Uganda’s total value of mineral  production soared from  Shs19.9 billion in FY 2020/21 to  
Our  
promise  
NATIONAL UNITY PLATFORM | 2026 
Shs202 billion in FY 2021/22,  driven by increased output in  limestone (UGX 93 billion), iron  ore (Shs72 billion), pozzolana  (UGX 17.7 billion), wolfram  (Shs6.8 billion), and gold  (Shs3.4 billion) 
That same report highlights  that only 20 of the 558 licensed  mining companies were  responsible for 98.8% of total  mining revenues (each remitting  at least Shs6 billion). 
However, transparency  challenges persist. The EITI  flags issues such as undisclosed  contracts, incomplete data  reporting from companies, and  discrepancies in gold export  figures—highlighting the urgent  need for improved governance  and monitoring systems 
Conclusion 
Uganda’s economic future hinges  on restoring fiscal discipline,  curbing reckless borrowing, and  eliminating wasteful expenditure.  The current trajectory—marked  by budget shortfalls, rising debt,  and misplaced priorities— 
undermines service delivery and  entrenches inequality. Public  financing must be reoriented  toward transparency, efficiency,  and national development.

the approved budgets. We will  
ensure that budget planning  
aligns with national and regional  
priorities. 
2.3. Reduce the Debt Burden 
We will halt reckless borrowing,  
prioritize concessional financing,  
and ensure that no new loan is  
approved without rigorous public  
scrutiny and a clear return-on

investment plan. We will discuss  and renegotiate our debts with  our creditors to a level Ugandans  can manage to repay within  a short period of time without  affecting key service delivery  indicators. 
2.4. Reform the Mineral  Sector 
We will enforce transparency in  mining and oil contracts, ring fence mineral and oil revenues  for education, health, and  infrastructure projects, and  empower the Uganda National  Mining Company to serve  public—not private— interests.  We will make sure all oil contracts  are in the in the interest of  Ugandans and disseminated for  public scrutiny. 
2.5. Promote Fair and Simple  Taxation 
We will simplify the tax system,  eliminate taxes on essential  items like menstrual products,  scholastic materials and  school data bundles, introduce  a PAYE tax-free threshold of  Ugx1000,000 regarded as low income earners. Any Ugandan  earning below 1million will not Pay  PAYE and reward tax compliance  with competitive incentives. 
2.6. Expand Domestic  
Revenue without Burdening  the Poor 
Through smarter tax  administration, digital  technologies, and closing  loopholes, we aim to raise  Uganda’s tax-to-GDP ratio by  at least 6 percentage points— 
without raising tax rates for  ordinary citizens. 
15
2.7. Enforce Austerity and  Lead by Example 
We will ensure that salaries for  top officials are within affordable  range for the nation, and perks  like car allowances for MPs  and ministers’ convoys will be  abolished. Leadership must  serve, not enrich. 
2.8. Reprioritize Social  
Spending 
Funds saved from cost-cutting  will be redirected to build  hospitals in underserved areas,  improve school infrastructure,  and expand access to clean  water and social protection. 
2.9. Restore Fiscal Rule of Law 
We will uphold the Charter for  Fiscal Responsibility, enforce  expenditure limits, and ensure  every public official is held  accountable for how public  funds are used. 
2.10. Revive Confidence in  Public Finance 
All public contracts, mining  agreements, and national  budgets will be published and  subjected to parliamentary and  public review. 
2.11. Expand Social Safety  Nets 
We will expand social safety nets like  in-kind transfers and food subsidies  to reduce poverty and promote  decent living and inclusive growth.  All individuals with physical and  mental disabilities that hinder them  from meaningful productivity will  be 100 percent catered for by the  government.

NATIONAL UNITY,  
REBUILD WAR-TORN  COMMUNITIES,  
AND ELIMINATE  
SECTARIANISM. 
INTRODUCTION: 
National unity, restoring war-torn  communities and elimination  of all forms of sectarianism  are widely regarded as critical  pillars for building sustainable  democracy, peace, and regional  development in a post war  country. In Uganda, national  unity, restoring war-torn  communities and elimination  of all forms of sectarianism are  complex issues, particularly in  the context of past conflicts  and human rights abuses.  Forgiveness is often viewed as  a crucial aspect of community  restoration and unity, with many  Ugandans emphasizing its  importance in co-existence and  rebuilding relationships. However,  the path to reconciliation is  multifaceted, involving not only  individual forgiveness but also  broader societal efforts toward  truth-telling, accountability, and  justice. 
“An outstanding  model is South  African President  Nelson Mandela,  who forgave  
leaders and agents  of the apartheid  government  
after South  
Africa’s transition  to multiracial  
democracy in 1994.  Mandela did not  directly forgive  in the name of  
others or make  
forgiveness into  a formal program  or procedure, but  rather his example  inspired many  
others to forgive.” 
Research indicates that  forgiveness plays a significant  role in community restoration in  Northern Uganda, allowing for  the reintegration of perpetrators  and fostering co-existence  with former tormentors. Many  Ugandans view forgiveness  as a way to construct better  relationships with those who  have wronged them, even when  perpetrators are not present.  Forgiveness of wrongs committed  and past hurts is an important  vehicle to achieve reconciliation  and co-existence in a society

that is wrought with past social  upheavals, fragile relationships  and painful memories.   
Despite progress, challenges  remain in achieving lasting  reconciliation and national unity  in the country. These include  tensions between state 
institutions and traditional  authorities, ethnic divisions, and  the ongoing need to address  the root causes of conflict.  Fostering national unity requires  open dialogue, collaboration  between different actors, and  a commitment to addressing  historical grievances. This  includes engaging with various  stakeholders, including civil  society organizations, religious  leaders, and traditional leaders.  By addressing past injustices and  fostering dialogue, Uganda can  work towards building a more  peaceful and unified future. 
SITUATIONAL  
ANALYSIS. 
Post-war Victims. 
Luwero, located in Central  Uganda lies at the heart of the  famous “Luwero Triangle” a  geographically sparse land —  consisting of Kiboga, Kyankwanzi,  Luweero, Mityana, Mubende,  Nakaseke, Nakasongola, and  Wakiso districts — that was  the site of the guerrilla fighting  between the National Resistance  Army (NRA) and the Uganda  National Liberation Army  (UNLA), commonly known as the  Bush War. Its peoples suffered  countless atrocities at the hands  of both sides of the conflict,  leading to massive displacement  
19
NATIONAL UNITY PLATFORM | 2026 
and plunging the region into  poverty from which it still suffers  today. Other armed groups,  such as the Federal Democratic  Movement of Uganda (FEDEMU)  and the Uganda Freedom  Movement (UFM), likewise  committed atrocities both before  and after the Bush War. 
Gulu is at the heart of the Acholi  sub-region and northern Uganda.  The over one million residents  of the North-Central Acholi  sub-region — consisting of the  districts of Agago, Amuru, Gulu,  Kitgum, Lamwo, Nwoya, and  Pader — bore the brunt of the  conflict with the Lord’s Resistance  Army (LRA). Over 90 percent  of the entire Acholi population  was displaced at some point  during the fighting, with many  spending over a decade in IDP  camps. In the aftermath of the  conflict, there was significant  secondary displacement  caused by land disputes due  in turn to acquisitions for  national parks and reserves as  well as for oil exploration. This  displacement further fueled the  historical neglect and violence  experienced by the Acholi people  on the national level. 
Yumbe is in the West Nile sub region. This sub-region, made  up of Arua, Adjumani, Koboko,  Maracha, Moyo, Nebbi, Terego,  Yumbe, and Zombo districts,  has been afflicted by numerous  insurgency movements after  the fall of Idi Amin, namely the  Uganda National Rescue Front  (UNRF) — both UNRF I and UNRF  II — and the West Nile Bank  Front (WNBF). Its over two million  ethnically diverse inhabitants —  consisting of the Alur, Jonam,  
Kakwa, Kuku, Lendu, Lugbara,  Madi and Okebu peoples —  also suffered from the spillover  effects of neighboring conflicts  in the northeastern Democratic  Republic of the Congo, South  Sudan (and formerly southern  Sudan), and northern Uganda,  all of which resulted in large  influxes of displaced persons. 
Amuria is on the edge of the Teso  sub-region in Eastern Uganda  towards the Karamoja sub region. The Eastern sub-region of  Teso consists of Amuria, Bukedea,  Kaberamaido, Katakwi, Kumi,  Ngora, Pallisa, Serere, and Soroti  districts. Named for the Iteso  people, the region’s population  of over one million suffered  from several conflicts, including  one between Force Obote Back  Again (FOBA) and the Ugandan  Peoples Front/Army (UPF/A); one  caused by LRA incursions; and  several fought between ethnic  groups — Karimojong, Bagisu,  Babuya, Bhatikhana, and Shana  — that continue through today,  fuelled by land disputes and land  grabs and further exacerbated  by environmental instability and  food insecurity. 
Kasese is in the southwestern  part of the country, bordering the  Democratic Republic of Congo.  The Western Rwenzori sub 
region, comprising Bundibugyo,  Kabarole, Kamwenge, Kasese,  Kyegegwa, Kyenjojo, and Ntoroko  districts, has experienced  instability and conflict since  before Ugandan independence.  Conflict between Bakonjo and  Bamba militias (later forming the  National Army for the Liberation  of Uganda (NALU)) over claims  regarding the recognition of  
the Rwenzururu Kingdom and  the Toro Kingdom have led to  mass killings of civilians on both  sides. The Allied Democratic  Front (ADF), formed from NALU  members and established as  an Islamist militia front, has  carried out a violent anti-civilian  insurgency campaign in the sub region that continues today. 
Evidence from the study by  Center for civil and human  rights at the University of Notre  Dame revealed that majority  (83.76%) of Victims of violence/ 
armed conflicts in the affected  parts of Uganda have not been  adequately compensated for  their suffering; majority (94.15%)  of families/relatives of family  members, or close friends have  not received fair payment from  the NRM government for their  suffering; majority ( 77.9%) of the  Leaders of organized armed  groups that were involved in  violence in affected parts of the  country have not adequately  apologized for wrongs they  committed and majority (68.11%)  of perpetrators of violence in  these affected places of the  country have not been held  accountable for their crimes. 
No wonder, poverty statistics  show that poverty in Uganda  remains overwhelmingly rural,  areas that have historically  faced both economic hardship  and conflict-related disruptions.  Of the 7.3 million people living in  absolute poverty, a staggering  5.3 million live in rural areas,  compared to 1.7 million in urban  centers. These figures highlight  the persistent economic divide  between Uganda’s countryside  and its growing towns and cities.

MANIFESTO 
Among the hardest-hit regions  is Karamoja, which recorded  the highest number of people  living in absolute poverty, with  937,500 individuals affected.  This situation has left millions of  affected families to building long  lasting anger and vengeance  awaiting the right timebomb. 
Yet forgiveness over revenge has  been widely suggested to help to  quell the renewal of violence and  allows people to interact with  one another as citizens so that  they can carry out the ordinary  functions of economic and  political cooperation, including  economic development,  commerce, and countless  matters of governance.  Cumulatively, forgiveness  contributes to sustainable peace  and economic development at  the national level. 
To-date, Uganda remains  hobbled by weaknesses in its  political system, disputes over  land and other property, a lack of  development aid, the breakdown  of family systems, and a lack of  implementation of appropriate  transitional justice measures  like trials, truth commissions,  reparations, apologies, and  memorialization. Within the  international community – 
international lawyers, human  rights activists, officials of  international organizations, and  the staff of NGOs focused on  peace-building – forgiveness is  little understood, widely ignored,  and often overshadowed by  other activities thought to be  more urgent. 
Ugandans regard forgiveness  not merely as a matter of  
21
relinquishing claims against their  perpetrators, but also as one of  constructing a better relationship  with them. The degree of  restoration varies greatly. For  instance, it is quite common for  victims to speak of forgiving  “in the heart” perpetrators who  are not present. Ugandans  voice support for forgiveness  at high rates despite the fact  that a range of other measures,  including repentance, truth telling, acknowledgment of  wrongs, apology, accountability,  compensation, reparations, and  development aid are widely  absent. 
A highly contested  
recruiting process 
In Uganda, only 3 out of 10  University graduates will be  able to find a job one year after  graduation. As if this is not bad  enough, jobs in both the private  sector and public service are  filled on the basis of nepotism,  tribalism and patronage rather  than competence. Even where it is  not an issue of nepotism, corrupt  public officers end up selling job  openings to the highest bidder  or fraudulently selling the same  job to multiple individuals. Given  the tribal diversity of Uganda—  which has more than fifty tribes,  the probability that one of ten  qualified individuals is from the  same tribe as the hiring manager  is very low. Though in Uganda it  is common to find public offices  and private organizations where  more than half of the employees  come from the same tribe or  region as the person in charge of  hiring decisions.

The consequence of  compromising the recruitment  process to hire family members,  friends and acquittances include  an incompetent and inefficient  workforce that compromises  service delivery. Where  recruitment is based on nepotism  and tribalism it increases tribal  divisions and rivalry as a result  of increased perceptions of  favouritism and discrimination  on the basis of tribe— that could  one day lead to tribal wars and  genocide.

A tribalist therefore is a  narrow-minded person who  thinks that only his or her people  should be accommodated at the  dinning table. Once this happens  to a country, then growth and  development cannot happen.

Yes it’s true that some groups  have benefitted immensely  from 40 years of NRM leadership  because of unfair distribution  of state resources including  scholarships and unfair  recruitment programs. 
It is not true that the Sabiny, for  instance, can’t have their people  working in top government  positions because are  incompetent. It is also not true  that the only competent people  in Uganda are Banyankole,  Baganda, Basoga and Acholis.  It is also not true that northern  people are generally good for  “Askari-security guard” jobs  and that ‘Chapati’ makers are  Basoga. 
All people are created equal and  blessed with unique capabilities.  
When you seat and make a  plan to discriminate others, then  you have half the capacity to  develop. 
A wide range of Salary  disparities in public  
service. 
Employment opportunities and  fair remuneration are one of  the important ways in which  individual persons and their  families can contribute and  benefit from economic growth  and access to basic services.  Equal access to opportunities  across all aspects of life is a  major prerequisite for inclusive  growth, socioeconomic  transformation and sustainable  improvement of both human  welfare and the environment.  It is therefore imperative that  government ensures equitable  remuneration to its workers in its  various Ministries, Departments  and Agencies. 
Despite the efforts by the  current government, there are  wide salary disparities between  
22
MANIFESTO 
the traditional civil service and  statutory bodies established by  Acts of Parliament (the other  public service). For instance,  a director in a Government  Ministry earns Shs2,369,300 per  month while a deputy director  in KCCA earns Shs27,000,000  per month. Other observations  reveal that some public officers  earn two-to-six times more than  their counterparts in other public  Institutions.

SHS 
2,369,300 
While a deputy director in  KCCA earns

27,000,000 
The salary disparities are so  wide that public officers in some  institutions are required to work  for several years to be able to  earn what their counterparts  earn in one year. Similarly, at  local government level, the  results show a wide salary  disparity of 50 percent between  the Chairperson and the Deputy  as well as between the Municipal  Mayor and the Deputy. The  difference between the annual  salary of the highest paid LG  political leader (Chairman LC  V) and the lowest paid leader  (Sub- County/ Town Council  Chairperson) is UGX. 21,216,000  per annum. In other words, it  
23
takes 7 years for the lowest paid  political leader to earn what  the highest paid political leader  earns in 1 year. 
There is also a wide disparity  between the annual salaries of  the top most paid 
(U1S) and least paid civil servant  (U8 Lower) equivalent to UGX.  57,172,778 (as of December, 2016).  This is a substantial difference  that became even bigger  following salary reviews of  specific civil servants in January,  2017 hence requiring redress.  Despite the possible underlying  causes of such a big difference,  which may include experience,  training, required standard of  living, and job requirements,  there is need to raise the threshold  for the least paid civil servants.  Whereas the Circular from the  Permanent Secretary, Ministry  of Public Service communicated  revision of salaries, the revision  was only restricted to the Head  of Public Service, Permanent  Secretaries, Chief Justice and the  Deputy Chief Justice, the above  increment did not cut across all  levels within the Public Service. 
Additionally, some institutions  had wide salary differentials  compared with their peers  elsewhere as well as significant  differentials among their own  staff. For example, there are  institutions where the ratio of the  highest earner and the lowest  earner is 51:1 (Uganda Coffee  Development Authority), 49:1  (Uganda Industrial Research  Institute), 40:1 (Uganda Land  Commission), 34:1 (National  Information Technology  Authority) and 33:1 (Uganda Road  Fund). The variations observed  
are likely to contribute to low  employee motivation, morale  and productivity among the  lowest paid earners. 
The study from equal  opportunity commission  revealed that the Salary  disparities in the public service  contribute negatively towards  efficiency and effectiveness of  services delivery. Among the  direct consequences included  absenteeism, low motivation,  corruption and late coming  among others.

EDUCATION,  
ENERGY, AND PUBLIC  INFRASTRUCTURE. 
INTRODUCTION 
Uganda, like many developing  countries, is in the early stages  of its demographic transition,  with a rapidly growing working 
age population expected for  the next decades. This presents  a vital opportunity to harness  a demographic dividend—but  only if strategic investments and  major policy adjustments and  shifts are made in education,  health, and skills development.  By allocating resources wisely  and increasing spending on  human capital—the knowledge,  skills, and mental and physical  well-being of the population— 
Uganda can unlock higher  productivity, better health  outcomes, and stronger  economic growth. 
SITUATION  
ANALYSIS 
Health 
Uganda’s health sector remains  severely under-resourced in  infrastructure, human resource  and essential supplies. As of  August 2024, the Prime Minister  admitted during a parliamentary  
session that 82 districts lack a  single public general hospital,  with UGX 6.74 trillion required to fill  the gap. At lower levels, 1,696 out  of 2,184 sub-counties and town  councils lack a Health Centre  III—leaving millions without  access to basic healthcare. 
In districts like Pader, Agago, and  Lamwo (Acholi sub-region), there is  not a single hospital. Most existing  Health Centre IVs offer just 24- 
bed capacities, which are grossly  dilapidated and inadequate for  the needs of growing populations  in this sub-region. 
26 
MANIFESTO 
Meanwhile, healthcare workers  across the country frequently  report shortages of protective  equipment and basic medical  supplies. 
Preventable diseases remain a  national crisis: Uganda ranks 3rd  globally in malaria cases and 8th  in deaths, with rural subregions  experiencing the highest  transmission rates (WHO 2022). 
At the same time, non communicable diseases (NCDs)  such as diabetes, hypertension,  and cancer are on the rise— posing a growing threat to public  health and requiring urgent  investment in preventive and  long-term care services. Between  33 and 35% of all deaths in  Uganda are now attributed to  NCDs. 
This reflects a broader crisis in  Uganda’s health system—one  that is largely dysfunctional  across the entire life cycle, from  maternal care to adult and  elderly health—undermining  individual well-being and  national productivity. 
Education 
Uganda’s education and  health systems have fallen  short in developing a skilled  and productive workforce. The  Human Capital Index (HCI)  for Uganda stands at 0.39 (on  a scale from 0 to 1), meaning  that under current health and  education conditions, the  average child will be only 39% as  productive as they could be with  full access to quality services.  This reflects significant gaps in  both educational quality and  health that constrain future  workforce productivity. 
27
While primary school enrolment  rose from 2.6 million in 1995 to  8.7 million by 2017, the average  Learning-Adjusted Years of  Schooling (LAYS) is only 4.3,  compared to 6.8 years of actual  schooling. This highlights  the poor quality of learning  outcomes despite increased  access. Rural regions suffer  significant infrastructure  deficits. In Napak District, for  example, none of the seven  sub-counties nor 20 parishes  have a government-aided  secondary school—despite  repeated official promises by  the NRM government. The rest  of Karamoja sub-region is in a  severe state. 
School attendance remains  uneven and inequitable. Only  40% of children aged 3–5 attend  early childhood education; 80%  of those aged 6–12 are in primary  school; and just 25% make it to  secondary school. Secondary  school 
enrolment among the richest  20% districts in Uganda is 43.1%,  five times higher than among  the poorest 20%, which stands  at just 8.2%. Enrolment is highest  in Kampala (52%) and lowest  in Acholi (7%)—signalling a  deliberate failure by the NRM  government to uplift the most  vulnerable Ugandans— citing  hard to reach areas. 
The cost of educating a child  in Uganda continues to strain  family incomes, pushing many  households into poverty. Some  families are forced to sell plots of  land to keep children in school— 
often without any guarantee  of school completion or future  employment. 
The NRM  
government  
celebrates its  
UPE programme  yet it allocates  a laughable  
UGX 20,000 per  primary pupil  
per year. In FY  
2024/25, only  
UGX 2.497 trillion  (about 2.9% of the  national budget)  was allocated  
to education— significantly  
below the UN 
recommended  threshold of 15%.  In comparison,  health received  only UGX.2.946  trillion (about 3.9%  of the national  budget), and social  protection a mere  UGX 355.79 billion  (about 0.2% of the  national budget)— compared to a  roughly 57% spent  on official meals,  allowances and  entertainment. 
Girls face systemic barriers.  Poverty, teenage pregnancy and  school-related abuse force many  out of school—60% of dropouts  cite costs, and 8% cite pregnancy  as the main reasons. Boys, on the  other hand, are often neglected  partly due to a common cultural  perception that “a man must  struggle,” leading many to drop  out prematurely due to lack of  support. 
In a nutshell, poor learning  outcomes limit productive  employment and economic  growth. Infrastructure gaps  leave entire regions underserved,  reinforcing inequality. Weak  financing and low public  investment continue to fuel high  dropout rates and persistent  inequity. 
Safe Drinking Water and  Sanitation 
Safe drinking water, proper  sanitation, and hygiene are vital  for societal wellbeing in countries  at any income level. Improved  water sources include piped water,  boreholes, protected wells and  springs, and packaged or 
delivered water. Globally, Sub  Saharan Africa lags behind in access  to safe water at 32%, compared  to 98.2% in Europe. In Uganda, just  18.7% of people use drinking water  from an improved source that is on  premises, available when needed,  and free from faecal and priority  chemical contamination, according  to Macrotrends data for 2022. 
A separate source, Water.org, states  that out of Uganda’s 48million  people, 38million (80%) lack access  to both safe drinking water and a  safe toilet. 
NATIONAL UNITY PLATFORM | 2026 
In terms of cost, Urban poor  
households sometimes spend  
more than 22% of their income  
buying water from vendors due  
to lack of reliable and affordable  
piped supply. 
Many rural families still spend  
over 58 minutes walking to  
collect water, reducing time for  
productive work and school— 
consistent with regional WASH  
surveys. Only 11% of rural  
households have access to  
piped water, compared to  
46% in urban areas, and 70%  
in Greater Kampala. More  
than 50% of households use  
pit latrines without a slab; 5%  
have no sanitation facility at all.  
In financial year 2024/25 only  
Shs516.78 billion was allocated  
for climate change mitigation,  
natural resources, environment  
including water resources  
management— a figure far  
below the need for the WASH  
facilities.

Transport and Energy Introduction 
Transport and energy sectors  power the economy, connect  communities, drive trade, and  improve quality of life. Yet, today,  millions of Ugandans remain  disconnected—by poor roads,  unreliable transport systems,  and limited access to clean and  affordable energy. The vast  majority of people have to rely  on neglected road network, while  rail, water, and air transport are  underdeveloped. In the energy  sector, the majority of Ugandans  rely on raw biomass, with  electricity access still low and  renewables like solar and wind  grossly underutilized. 
SITUATION  
ANALYSIS 
Road Transport 
Land transport is by far the most  utilized in Uganda, handling over  96% of cargo and passenger  traffic (IMF, 2024). Uganda’s road  network spans approximately  159,364 kilometres, but only  6,338 km is paved nationally,  representing up to 3.9 percent  of the total road network. The  roads are classified into; National  roads: ~20,854 km; District roads:  ~38,603 km; Urban roads: ~19,959  km and Community access  roads= ~79,948 km. Based on  random assessment by the NUP  Policy and research department,  
29
of the paved roads, only 20% is in  fair condition, while the rest, 80%,  are in poor and deteriorating  road conditions. Evidence from  Kampala City scoping study  by the African Cities Research  Consortium and Kampala  Capital City Authority indicated  that Kampala which contributes  up to 75% of the national  revenue collection and 65%  of the country’s GDP has only  600km (about 29%) of the City’s  Road system being primarily  paved or tarmacked out of the  total length of 2100km. Most of  the paved roads in Kampala,  totalling 360km, are over 35  years old and have undergone  multiple patching and repairs.  A well-paved road will require  reconstruction after 15-20 years. 
Out of the total country’s road  network of 159,364 kilometres,  central government only funds  about 13% through UNRA/ 
Ministry of works and the  remaining 87% responsible for  local governments which are  significantly underfunded.  This is the reason why safety  on Uganda’s roads remains a  major concern. The Uganda  Police recorded over 12,000  road traffic accidents annually,  with an average of 10 people  dying per day from crashes,  according to the Office of the  Auditor General’s 2022 report.  While there are several factors  contributing to these accidents,  mostly the structure and design  of our roads. 
Railway Transport 
More than 60 years after getting  independent, Uganda running on  a railway network inherited from  the colonial era. Even then, this  network is largely 
underutilized. Of the 1,250 kilometres  of metre-gauge railway, only about  321 kilometres are operational  today—mainly the line from  Malaba through Tororo to Kampala,  with links to Port Bell and Jinja. 
Only recently, in May 2025, did  Uganda sign an $800 million  loan agreement with the Islamic  Development Bank (IsDB) in  to fund the construction of its  long-delayed Standard Gauge  Railway (SGR),to connect to  Kenya’s SGR and increase  efficiency in transporting goods  from Mombasa port (Reuters,  May 2025). 
Water Transport 
Uganda is endowed with large  water bodies, including Lake  Victoria, Lake Albert, and Lake  Kyoga, which present big  opportunities for inland water  transport. In total, water bodies  cover approximately 15% of  Uganda’s surface area. 
Like railway, water transport  has been neglected by the  NRM regime. The government  operates only a few ferries while  privately-owned risky boats  dominate Uganda’s water  transport for both passenger  and freight services. 
NATIONAL UNITY PLATFORM | 2026 
30
MANIFESTO 
Air Transport 
Uganda remains poorly  connected by air, with a national  aviation system that falls far short  of its economic and geographic  potential. While Entebbe  International Airport has recently  shown signs of revival—handling  2.24 million international  passengers in 2024, a 16%  increase from 2023—this growth  has been largely attributed to  loss-making Uganda Airlines’  expanded routes and the entry  of new regional carriers like Kush  Air and Premier Airlines. Cargo  activity also rose, reaching 67,731  tonnes in 2024, up from 59,073  tonnes in 2023, according to  media reports. But behind these  figures is a crisis. 
Entebbe remains Uganda’s only  fully functional international  airport, and even it is operating  below its full potential. The rest  of the country is virtually cut off  by air. A network of 13 upcountry  aerodromes—including Arua,  Gulu, 
Kasese, Kisoro, Jinja, Soroti, Moroto,  Tororo, Masindi, Lira, Mbarara,  Pakuba (in Murchison Falls  National Park), and Kidepo—has  been neglected for years. These  regional airports should have  served to connect Uganda’s  diverse regions to the capital and  to each other. Instead, they suffer  from chronic underfunding, poor  maintenance, and extremely low  air traffic. 
Meanwhile, the Uganda Air Cargo  Corporation (UACC)—established  to support export logistics and  regional cargo transport— 
has become a symbol of state  failure. According to the 2024  
31
Auditor General’s Report, UACC  is among the worst-performing  public enterprises, alongside  Uganda Airlines and the Uganda  Railways Corporation. Its fleet  is largely grounded, revenues  are far below targets and not  breaking even for years, assets  are grossly underutilized, and it  holds massive unpaid receivables,  some outstanding for over five  years. These indicators paint a  stark picture of mismanagement,  financial inefficiency, and lack of  accountability. 
The problem goes deeper. Under the  NRM government, air transport has  never been treated as a strategic  priority for national development.  The Uganda Civil Aviation Authority  (UCAA)—mandated to oversee  and promote air transport— has  been mired in incompetence and  scandal. Gen.Museveni himself  recently acknowledged irregularities  in UCAA’s recruitment process,  going so far as to order the dismissal  of over 150 staff. This is symptomatic  of a broader governance failure  that continues to undermine the  aviation sector. 
Energy Sector 
Uganda’s energy sector falls far  short of its potential to transform  lives, drive industrialisation,  and power equitable economic  development. Millions of  Ugandans still lack access to  affordable and reliable energy,  despite large infrastructure  investments that have been  dogged by high costs due to  corruption. Less than 20% of  rural households are connected  to the national grid, and in urban  areas, frequent power outages  and high tariffs make electricity  
NATIONAL UNITY PLATFORM | 2026 

unreliable and unaffordable for  most households and businesses. 
Uganda enjoys now four large  hydro power plants at Nalubaale,  Kiira, Isimba and Karuma, with a  combined generation capacity  of 1,163.2 megawatts. Other  sources such as Kigwabya,  XsaboNkonge solar power in  Mubende, etc have added  another 888.8 megawatts. This  brings Uganda’s total installed  electricity generation capacity  to 2,052 megawatts. Despite  this sharp increase in electricity  generation, many Ugandans  struggle to access it in terms of  connection to grid and cost. For  instance, both grid and off-grid  connections account for 42% of  access to electricity in Uganda.  So why doesn’t everyone have  access to electricity yet it is  generated here? 
A critical challenge is the  distribution of the electricity grid.  Given that a significant portion,  over 70%, of Uganda’s population  resides in rural and remote areas,  the existing grid infrastructure  doesn’t reach them, resulting  in a substantial portion of the  population being without access  to electricity. The Uganda National  Household Survey 2019/2020  stated that the Ugandan electricity  grid reached 18.9 % of Ugandans,  mainly in urban areas. Off-grid  access describes alternatives to  the national grid, such as Solar  Home Systems, Mini grid systems,  or smaller power-generating  devices.  
The per capita  
electricity  
consumption in  
Uganda was only 75  kWh/a in 2019, while  in Germany it is 6787  kWh/a. 
Notably, Uganda’s power sector  is primarily driven by renewable  energy sources, accounting for  an impressive 98% of electricity  generation. Fossil fuels contribute  only 2% to the electricity mix,  reflecting a strong commitment  to sustainability as well as a high  potential of resources. The solar  resources are enormous and  delivered access to electricity for  38% of the population throughout  the country in 2019. 
Biomass 
Biomass—mainly firewood and  charcoal—accounts for over  85% of Uganda’s total energy  consumption. This heavy  
32
MANIFESTO 
reliance is fuelling deforestation  and exposing millions, especially  women and children, to health  risks from indoor air pollution.  The lack of investment in clean  cooking alternatives remains a  public health and environmental  crisis. 
Solar Energy 
Solar energy offers a clear,  decentralised solution to  Uganda’s rural electrification  challenge. Yet, despite strong  potential, the sector has  remained underfunded and  marginalised in national  planning. There is no coordinated  
national push to scale up off-grid  solar for schools, health centres,  and households. 
Wind Energy 
Wind energy remains an  untapped opportunity. Viable  wind speeds have been identified  in regions such as Karamoja and  the Lake Victoria basin, but no  meaningful investments or pilot  projects have followed. 
Conclusion 
Uganda has a young, dynamic  population full of potential—but  without serious investment in  
education, health, skills, and jobs,  that demographic dividend and  potential will remain wasted. Our  schools are underfunded, our  health system is crumbling, and  millions of youths are stuck in low paying, and insecure work. This is  not just a development failure—it  is a national emergency. We can  only build a prosperous Uganda  by first investing in its people.  Human capital development  is the foundation for economic  growth, social justice, and  national transformation. Without  it, the demographic dividend will  become a demographic disaster.

By linking all  major regions, we will  strengthen trade, enhance  access to markets, and  promote inclusive national  development, ensuring  that no part of Uganda  remains isolated from  the opportunities of a  connected economy. 
4.4.3 Safe, Affordable, and  Reliable Water Transport 
• We will modernise key ports  and landing sites on Lake  Victoria, Lake Albert, and  Lake Kyoga, including the  construction of passenger  terminals and cargo  handling facilities. 
• We will acquire state-of the-art ferries to provide  safe, efficient, and reliable  public water transport  services. 
• We will Support private  water transport operators  in acquiring modern boats  and ferries, enhancing  safety, efficiency, and  service quality across  Uganda’s waterways. 
4.4.4 Connect Regions,  Boost Tourism through Air  Transport 
• We will upgrade at least  five regional airports  (Gulu, Arua, Kasese, Soroti,  and Mbarara) to handle  commercial passenger  flights by 2030. 
NATIONAL UNITY PLATFORM | 2026 38
MANIFESTO 39
• We will reform Uganda  Airlines and UACC into  transparent, accountable,  and commercially  viable entities with strict  performance audits. 
• We will establish a  substantial Domestic Air  Travel Fund to incentivise  private operators to open  safe, affordable domestic  routes. 
• We will position Uganda  as a regional air cargo hub  for agricultural exports by  investing in cold storage  and cargo logistics at  Entebbe and upgraded  regional airports. 
4.5 Energy to Powering  Homes, Businesses, and  Industry 
4.5.1 Expand Grid Access 
• We will connect all major  trading centres, schools,  and health facilities across  the country to reliable  electricity—through the  national grid, mini-grids, or  solar systems—within five  years, ensuring consistent  power for economic growth  and service delivery. 
• We will ensure that at least  60% of rural households  have access to electricity— through the national  grid, mini-grids, or solar  systems—by 2030. 
• We will lower electricity  tariffs by renegotiating  costly contracts and  expanding affordable  renewable energy  generation. 
• We will delete connection  costs to grid for all users  including domestic  consumption. 
4.5.2 Reduce Biomass  
Dependence 
• We will implement a  national programme  to expand biogas and  improved cookstoves,  aiming to reduce household  reliance on firewood and  charcoal by 40% within five  years. 
• We will promote tree  planting and community  woodlots to restore forest  cover and provide a  sustainable supply of  biomass, while expanding  alternative clean cooking  energy sources. 
4.5.3 Scale Up Solar 
• We will make solar the  centrepiece of rural  electrification, aiming to  increase access from the  current 12% to at least 40%  of off-grid rural households  within five years. 
• We will invest in research  and development to  establish a vibrant  solar energy subsector,  harnessing Uganda’s  equatorial advantage to  expand solar energy use  and create green jobs. 
4.5.4 Unlock Wind Energy 
• We will establish pilot  large-scale wind farms in  Karamoja and the Lake  Victoria basin by 2028,  targeting the generation  
NATIONAL UNITY PLATFORM | 2026 
of at least 50 MW of clean  energy for the national  grid. 
• We will offer tax incentives,  grants, and low-interest  financing to private  investors to develop at least  20 wind-solar hybrid mini 
grids for rural communities  by 2030, expanding access  to affordable electricity. 
4.5.5 Scrapping Value  
Added Tax on electricity  domestic consumers 
• We will, introduce an  amendment to the VAT Act  to remove VAT on electricity  consumers, effective 1st  July, 2026. The effect of  this, shall be to reduce the  tariff for the category of  consumers from almost  Shs. 900 (US$ 25 cents) to  Shs. 750 (approximately  US$ 20) cents. 
• We expect the immediate  reduction in the tariffs to  support many Small and  Medium Enterprises (SMEs)  to employ more workers  as business cash flows  improve on account of a  reduced tariff. 
4.5.6 Renegotiating the  Bujagali generation tariff  in order to reduce the end  user tariff. 
• Our Government will invite  the owners of Bujagali  hydropower dam for a  negotiation to lower the  generation tariff from US$  8.4 cents to $ 6.0 cents.  We will be offering them  an opportunity to develop  another power dam like  Ayago Power Station at  better terms than Bujagali  dam. 
• A lower tariff for Bujagali  is expected to lead to a  lower generation tariff and  ultimately a lower end user  tariff. 
4.5.7 UEDCL will have  
an opportunity to issue  a publically guaranteed  diaspora bond. 
• UEDCL will have access  to investment resources  to invest in rehabilitating,  expanding and  modernising the electricity  distribution network. This  is expected to increase  
electricity access, reliability  of supply and affordability  of electricity since the  company will be receiving  investment finance at  relatively better terms than  the current market rates. 
• Overall, the scrapping  of VAT on domestic  consumers, a renegotiated  Bujagali tariff and UEDCL  benefiting from investment  funds from diaspora bonds  is expected to lower the end  user tariff from the current  Shs. 956/= to utmost Shs.  500. 
• With domestic consumers  paying not more than Shs.  500 per unit, it is expected  that the cost for using  electricity for cooking  would have come down  to outcompete Liquid  Petroleum Gas (LPG) and  biomass like charcoal.

INTRODUCTION: 
Uganda has one of the world’s  most youthful and fastest growing populations. Uganda  has one of the youngest and  fastest-growing populations in  the world and is among the top  four (4) globally. Yet, our economy  is failing to create adequate  and decent jobs for the youthful  population. Economic growth  registered in the past has not  resulted in a sufficient structural  transformation in employment.  Over 75% of our population is  under 30, but millions of youths  are trapped in unemployment,  underemployment, or informal  
work with little pay, no job  security or uncertain future  prospects. The demand for wage  workers in the private sector has  not kept up to speed with the  growth in the labour force. The  low job creation in the formal  private sector is a critical factor  behind Uganda’s lack of job  transformation. Evidence from  Uganda’s Census report 2024  highlights that majority (50.9%)  of youth (aged 18–30 years) are  not in education, employment  or training [by gender 57.5 % for  female and 42.7% for Male]. 
The high cost of doing business  has continued to hamper  Uganda’s economy from  generating enough productive  and decent jobs. Although  Uganda has made a 16 percent  improvement in doing business  in the last five years, more still  needs to be done, especially  regarding easing access to  construction permits, electricity  access, trading across borders,  registering property, paying taxes  and access to affordable credit.  Despite the reforms made in the  financial sector, interest rates in  Uganda remain high, standing  
42
MANIFESTO 
at between 20 percent and 23  percent; hence, the majority  of micro, small and medium  enterprises, which represents  about 74 percent, are constrained  by access to affordable credit.  This leaves about 85% of actively  working Ugandans trapped in  the informal sector—as boda  riders, street vendors, casual  labourers, or unpaid family  workers— according to the  National Labour Force Survey of 
2016-2017. According to Women in  Informal Employment Globalising  and Organising (WIEGO) report  2025, this figure is at 90%. 
Recent decent work and  economic growth metrics  indicate that unemployment rate  for the persons between aged  (14-64 years) is 14.5% for female  and 10.7% for male (Census,2024  results). But this hides the true  crisis: people are working, but not  earning adequately compared  to increasing standards of living,  inflation and fragility of the  market prices. 
University graduates continue to  roam the streets because their  skills don’t match market needs.  In recent years, many have  been forced to seek work in the  Middle East as domestic workers  or security guards—often  under exploitative and abusive  conditions that border on  modern-day slavery. Facts from  the Uganda Bank’s Association  indicate that each year, more  than 110,000 Ugandans go out  to look for jobs, with the biggest  destinations being Saudi Arabia,  Qatar, Yemen, and other parts  
43
in Europe and the Americas.  Labor externalisation has  potential source for revenue  generation with Shs25b received  from migrate workers in the  years 2022&2023 in form of  expression of interest fees, fines,  accreditation, job orders (local  &foreign) and license fees.  Compared to countries like Egypt  which gets nearly Shs90trillion  from it migrate workers, the  Ugandan figure is too low. This  could be explained by the fact  that the Ugandan skill sets are  not competitive on global scale  thus end up engaging in casual  and low paying jobs which end  up exploiting them. 
Low survival rate of businesses in  Uganda despite being one of the  most entrepreneurial countries  in the world has also limited job  growth. According to the World  Bank Group jobs strategy for  inclusive growth report 2019,  Ugandan firms do not suffer  from barriers to entry, there are  signs that they may suffer from  barriers to growth. Firm survival  rates are declining in Uganda.  Only one out of four firms remain  operational after the first five  years of existence. The Global  Entrepreneurship Monitor survey  identifies Uganda as the country  with the most entrepreneurial  culture in the world regarding  how business opportunities are  viewed and cherished. 
Our economy remains overly  dependent on subsistence  agriculture, which employs  more than 60% of Ugandans  but offers low productivity and  
income, while industries and  services are not growing fast  enough to absorb the swelling  youth population. Slow pace of  urbanization has resulted into  sluggish rural-urban migration  leaving a huge proportion of  the labour force trapped in low productive agriculture. The slow  reduction in the agricultural  labour force explains Uganda’s  relatively slow urbanisation  process. Urban centres, towns  and cities offer a collection of  more wage jobs in higher value added sectors and off-farm  informal sector opportunities.  The World Bank Group jobs  strategy for inclusive growth  report 2019 notes that the low  agricultural yields are responsible  for reduced opportunities  for urbanization by reducing  resources for diversification and  migration. 
The quality of jobs in Uganda  remains low, with 78% of the  labour force engaged in  vulnerable employment. Most  jobs in the country are in the  informal sector with majority  characterized by low pay and  job insecurity which remains a  strong hindrance to the country’s  jobs transformation agenda.  The informal sector in Uganda  employs about 13.3 million people  out of the 15.8 million working  population representing about  85 percent of total employment.  Labour relations in the informal  sector are primarily based on  casual employment, kinship  and social relations rather than  contractual arrangements with  formal guarantees. 
The following

sectors are targeted  areas for producing  10million new jobs. 
Tourism Sector and  
related value chain. 
Tourism is one of the world’s  largest and fastest-growing  industries, accounting for  roughly 10% of global GDP and  generating one in every five  new jobs worldwide over the  past five years (World Travel  & Tourism Council, 2023). In  
Uganda, tourism is a critical pillar  
of the economy, contributing  
approximately 7.5% of GDP and  
earning about USD 1.5 billion  
in foreign exchange annually  
(Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and  
Antiquities, 2023).

MANIFESTO 
Uganda’s rich natural  endowments—such as the  endangered mountain gorillas  of Bwindi and Mgahinga, the  source of the Nile, vast lakes, and  extensive biodiversity—position  it as a unique destination within  East Africa. Despite this, much  of Uganda’s tourism potential  remains underexploited and  less commercialized compared  to regional peers like Kenya  and Tanzania. Eco-tourism and  community-based tourism offer  substantial growth opportunities,  given Uganda’s conservation  and cultural heritage. 
With targeted investment in  infrastructure, marketing, and  sustainable tourism practices,  The NUP government will  significantly increase visitor  numbers, boost revenue, and  create jobs, ultimately becoming  a leading destination in Africa. 
SITUATION  
ANALYSIS. 
Uganda is internationally  recognized among the top  10 countries globally for its  exceptional tourist attractions,  including the iconic mountain  gorillas, the source of the  Nile, diverse wildlife, and rich  cultural heritage (World Travel &  Tourism Council, 2023). Despite  this global crown, significant  tourism opportunities remain  underexploited. 
In 2019, tourism contributed  approximately 7.7% to Uganda’s  GDP, but the sector was severely  impacted by the COVID-19  pandemic, dropping to around  2.5% in 2020. This decline  
45
led to a loss of roughly 40%  of tourism-related jobs, with  employment in the sector falling  from 536,600 in 2019 to about  321,960 in 2020 (Uganda Bureau  of Statistics, 2021). In the year  2023, international tourist arrivals  increased by 56 percent to 1.274  million tourists compared to  814,085 arrivals in 2022 and the  peak of 1.52 million in 2019. The  international tourism receipts  reached USD 1.03 billion in 2023.  By 2024, the broader services  sector—which includes tourism,  trade, transport, and finance— accounted for 42.6% of GDP.  Tourism receipts rebounded to  an estimated USD 1.47 billion in  2024, signalling gradual recovery  (Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and  Antiquities, 2024). 
Despite its economic  importance, the  tourism sector  
remains chronically  underfunded. In  the FY2024/25  
national budget  of UGX 72 trillion,  only about 289.6  billion was allocated  to the tourism  
development  
programmes and  its promotion  
programmes.  
Only Shs 55 billion  was allocated to  
Uganda’s Missions  Abroad to support  the Uganda Tourism  Board (UTB) to  
market Uganda to  potential tourists,  market our exports  and attract more  investors— an  
amount insufficient  to fully unlock  
Uganda’s tourism  potential (Ministry  of Finance, Planning  and Economic  
Development,  
2024). 
Marketing challenges are  significant. According to the  International Growth Centre  (IGC), 60% of foreign tourists  learn about Uganda’s attractions  primarily through word-of-mouth,  indicating low international  consumer awareness, especially  in key markets like Europe,  Australia, and China. Marketing  efforts remain fragmented and  sporadic, limiting Uganda’s  brand visibility. Additionally, the  Greater Kampala Metropolitan  Area (GKMA), the main gateway  for tourists, faces issues such  as congestion, pollution, petty  crime, and an unattractive urban  environment, which diminish the  country’s overall appeal (World  Bank, 2023). 
NATIONAL UNITY PLATFORM | 2026 
Moreover, while Uganda  possesses abundant natural and  cultural tourism assets, value  addition and commercialization  remain limited, leaving much of  the sector’s potential untapped.  Despite efforts by the players,  evidence indicates that there  is a decline in lion populations,  from 373 to 275, suggesting  ongoing challenges in predator  conservation; the average  length of stay decreased from 8.3  nights to 7.6, and the proportion  of leisure tourists dropped  from 19.3% to 15.7% by end of  FY2023/24, underscoring a shift  in tourist behavior. 
Incidences of human-wildlife  conflicts increased from 3,436  to 4,414, signaling the need for  better strategies to manage  interactions between wildlife  and local communities. Strategic  interventions are essential to  revitalize Uganda’s tourism  industry, focusing on upgrading  infrastructure, conservation  efforsts, strengthening marketing  efforts, and enhancing the visitor  experience through professional  customer service. 
Tourism has high transformative  power to Uganda’s economy if  fully harnessed. For example,  according to the World Bank  survey for Uganda in 2013,  Attracting 100,000 additional  leisure tourists would add 11  percent to exports and 1.6 percent  to GDP; Persuading a tourist to  spend one additional night in  Uganda would add 7 percent to  exports and 1.0 percent to GDP; 8  percent annual growth in leisure  and conference tourists would  generate an additional USD 220  million in receipts per annum. 
These facts make a compelling  case for us to prioritise the  funding and implementation of  strategies focusing on attracting  tourists, make them stay longer  and spend more in the country  and drive its growth. 
In terms of contribution to  employment in the economy,  Tourism will generate 239,000  jobs directly each year for the  manifesto period. This includes  employment by hotels, travel  agents, airlines and other  passenger transportation  services including commuter  services. The total contribution  of Tourism to employment  (including wider effects from  investment, the supply chain  and induced income impacts  is projected at 2,527,500 jobs by  2030 (of total employment). 
Uganda’s tourism sector is well  poised to be the leading growth  and development sector in the  country over the manifesto  period. This is in part due to  the expansive array of tourist  attractions the country is blessed  with including ten national  parks that boast a cocktail of  fascinating wildlife species,  various mountains, waterfalls  and cultural sites, including 12  Wildlife Reserves; 5 Community  Wildlife Management Areas;  and 13 Wildlife Sanctuaries.  The ten National Parks include  Queen Elizabeth, Lake Mburo,  Murchison Falls, Kidepo Valley,  Kibale, Mount Elgon, Rwenzori  Mountains, Semuliki, Mgahinga  Gorilla, and Bwindi Impenetrable  National Parks. These parks  display the best in East Africa.  Their Rift Valley landscapes and  tropical forests make dramatic  
backdrops to an extensive variety  of flora and fauna. 

Firms and the related  value chain 
Manufacturing plays a crucial  role in economic growth and  development, reflected in its  contribution to Gross Domestic  Product (GDP) and overall  development. The multiplier  effect of manufacturing is  exciting – every shilling of  output in the sector generates  levels of economic activity  across society through its  ecosystem, related value chains  and job creation. No sector in  Uganda does more to generate  broadscale economic growth  and, ultimately, higher living  
46
MANIFESTO 
standards than manufacturing.  Uganda’s manufacturing sector  is composed mainly of food  processing, beverages, and  tobacco, saw milling, paper and  printing, bricks and cement,  steel and metal products,  textile clothing and footwear,  chemicals, petroleum and other  chemical products, non-metallic  minerals, among others. 
According to the National  Development Plan III (NDP III),  manufacturing is essential for  the growth of the country. It has  a high potential for enhanced  economies of scale for factor  productivity and deeper, more  dynamic, and stronger forward  and backward linkages with  other sectors. In addition, it has  a greater diversification into a  variety of economic activities - a  robust manufacturing sector is  expected to accelerate Uganda’s  industrialization agenda. 
The manufacturing sector is a  key engine of growth in Uganda  due to its strong linkages and  spill-over effects. In Uganda, the  sector consumes a staggering  66.7 percent of all the power  generated, contributes 18.6  percent to the GDP, 19 percent  of the total exports to the global  market and 14 percent of the tax  revenue collected. The number  of industrial establishments in  Uganda increased from 80 in  1986 to 4,920 in 2019 and over 1.3  million people are employed in  the Industrial Sector. 
According to a report by  the Uganda Manufacturers  
47
Association, the manufacturing  sector is dominated by small  and medium enterprises (SMEs),  which make up 93.5% of firms  operating in the sector. SMEs  are the drivers of the Ugandan  economy for they make up  close to 90% of the businesses  in Uganda. When the SMEs in  Uganda, especially those in the  manufacturing sector ecosystem  are well supported and enabled  to realize their potential, the 
employment levels of the  country will improve, economic  development of the country  will be enabled, and financial  inclusion as a goal will be  achieved. 
The sector has the potential to do  better but needs to be deliberately  supported in its efforts and  on its journey. Although the  manufacturing sector in Uganda  has undoubtedly gone through  a leap of developments in the  last three decades, it has the  potential to do better and needs  to be supported to thrive leading  to economic growth, job creation  and poverty eradication which  are key priorities in NUP Manifesto  2026. The manufacturing  sector is seen as a key driver  for economic growth and  employment over the manifesto  period, with the potential to  absorb a large number of the  600,000 people who enter the  Ugandan job market annually. 
Industrial Parks and Investment  Promotion. Uganda has  increasingly adopted industrial  parks as a policy tool for  
stimulating economic growth.  The existing industrial parks  include the Namanve Park (with  190 companies operating);  Liao Shen Park in Kapeeka  (19 companies); Sino-Uganda  Industrial Park in Mbale (18  companies); Luzira Park (11  companies); Bweyogerere Park  (8 companies); and MMP in  Buikwe (6 companies). Other  operational industrial parks  include: Jinja, Soroti, Kasese,  Mbarara, and Tian Tang-Mukono  Industrial Parks. These parks are  geographically designated zones  planned for manufacturing,  trade, and service industries.  The Kampala Industrial and  Business Park (KIBP) is the largest  and most developed, and hosts  a significant portion of the  country’s industrial activity. 
According to the International  Growth Centre (IGC), firms  located within industrial  parks consistently outperform  those outside the parks in key  performance areas such as sales,  purchases, wages, employment,  exports, taxes, and capital  investment. This performance  underscores the potential of  industrial parks as catalysts for  enhancing productivity and  competitiveness in Uganda’s  private sector. The total  contribution of firms and related  value chain to employment  (including wider effects from  investment, the supply chain  and induced income impacts is  projected at 6,000,000 jobs by  2030 (of total employment).

Sports and the entire  
entertainment sector 
Uganda’s rich cultural heritage— with 56 officially recognized  indigenous communities, and  estimates extending up to 65— offers vast potential for the  growth of creative enterprises. A  mapping of cultural and creative  industries by the UNESCO  National Commission of Uganda  in 2009, although dated and in  need of an update, highlighted  that the culture sector contributes  significantly to economic growth,  job creation, export earnings,  and promotes social inclusion,  cultural diversity, and human  resource development. 
Uganda has also consistently  participated in and excelled  
49
at various sports on the global  stage, particularly in athletics.  From the athletics track to the  netball court, cricket pitch,  boxing ring, basketball court,  and football field, the country’s  athletes continue to raise  Uganda’s profile internationally.  This momentum presents a  unique opportunity to harness  the power of sports for holistic  economic development. 
Beyond medals and individual  accolades, these sporting  achievements generate both  direct and indirect socio 
economic benefits for Ugandan  society. Sporting victories serve  as powerful unifiers, helping  
to bridge cultural, social, and  political divides—and fostering a  sense of national pride and unity  that strengthens social cohesion.  In fact, participation in sports  and cultural activities—at any  level—has long proven effective  in uniting people from diverse  traditional backgrounds. 
Sports also provide a constructive  outlet for youth, equipping them  with essential life skills, offering  positive engagement, and  helping reduce the risk of crime  and negative influences. 
Economically, sports contribute  to job creation across multiple  sectors. These include: 
NATIONAL UNITY PLATFORM | 2026 
Direct employment for athletes,  coaches, team staff, and  administrators; 
Media and broadcasting  opportunities for journalists,  camera crews, producers, and  technical staff; 
Roles in hospitality and tourism— from hotels and restaurants  to transport services during  events; and opportunities in the  sports business sector, including  equipment manufacturing,  marketing, merchandising, and  facility management. 
The situation. The global rise of  Cultural and Creative Industries  (CCIs) has demonstrated that  investing in creativity yields  substantial economic and social  returns. Countries that actively  support their artists, filmmakers,  musicians, and designers  reap benefits not only through  increased tourism but also  through boosts in innovation,  entrepreneurship, exports, and  job creation. Uganda stands  on the threshold of a similar  transformation, with a vibrant  cultural and sporting landscape  that could drive inclusive national  development. 
Music festivals, for instance, are  more than entertainment—they  stimulate tourism, a critical pillar  of Uganda’s economy, while  also serving as marketplaces  for creative goods and services.  They attract investment, inspire  innovation, and foster skill  development. Local musicians  gain platforms to grow their  careers; artisans connect  with broader markets; and  
young entrepreneurs discover  new business opportunities.  Uganda’s music, film, and arts  sectors, particularly youth-led,  show enormous promise. But  only a handful of internationally  recognized talents have  emerged, supported by access  to home studios and digital  platforms. 
Festivals such as Bayimba,  Roast and Rhyme, and Nyege  Nyege have gained traction,  attracting both domestic and  international audiences, and  creating ripple effects across  the creative value chain—from  performance to hospitality.  Similarly, the sports and tourism  sectors are closely intertwined.  Sporting events, both local and  international, bring in spectators  who engage with the country’s  broader tourism offerings— from national parks to cultural  heritage sites. This creates a  strategic opportunity to market  Uganda as a complete cultural  and sports tourism destination. 
Despite these emerging  opportunities, Uganda’s  government has historically  underinvested in the creative  and sports sectors, limiting  their potential to contribute  meaningfully to national  development. While individual  artists and sports figures  continue to shine through  personal effort, there remains a  lack of consistent state support,  coordinated policy frameworks,  and dedicated public funding  for creative industries and  grassroots sports development.  National budgets have often  allocated minimal resources to  
these sectors, viewing them as  peripheral rather than central to  economic transformation. 
The few thriving cultural  festivals and international sports  successes in Uganda have  largely depended on private  sponsors, development partners,  or individual efforts—rather than  a clear, deliberate government  strategy. Infrastructure to  support culture and sports— such as community theatres, arts  hubs, and sports fields—remains  limited, unevenly distributed,  or poorly maintained. Notably,  the Uganda National Cultural  Centre (UNCC), which should be  central to cultural development,  has steadily declined and grown  increasingly invisible in national  discourse. 
This lack of investment  undermines talent  development—particularly  in rural areas where access  to facilities, mentorship, and  opportunities is severely limited.  There is an urgent need for  strategic and sustained public  investment in both sports and  culture as pillars of national  development in order to  unlock the full potential of  Uganda’s cultural richness  and youthful population. The  total contribution of sports and  entire entertainment sector to  employment (including wider  effects from investment, the  supply chain and induced  income impacts is projected at  1,472,500 jobs by 2030 (of total  employment).

INTRODUCTION: 
Agriculture remains the most  important sector and pillar of  Uganda’s Economy, employing  about 79% of Uganda’s working  age population and contributing  about 46% of the total export  earnings and providing a large  share of raw materials for the  industry, and employing 65% of  the total population. The sector  
comprises approximately 65%  crop production, 25% livestock,  and 10% fisheries. Key crops  include coffee, bananas, oil  seeds (sesame, soybean,  sunflower), tea, cotton, cereals,  fresh produce, and vegetables.  Livestock encompasses cattle,  goats, pigs, and poultry. 
Uganda is blessed with fertile  lands and diverse climates.  Eighty(80%) percent of the land is  arable, yet only 35% is cultivated,  according to the UN Food and  Agriculture Organisation (FAO).  The country is rich in freshwater  reserves, and two rainy seasons  support continuous agricultural  production.

AGRICULTURE 
Remains the most important sector and pillar of  
Uganda’s Economy, employing about 
79% 
Of Uganda’s working  
age population 

Uganda’s agriculture landscape  is classified into nine agro ecological zones, each adapted  to different crops—from  bananas and coffee around  Lake Victoria to drought-resistant  grains in the north and east 
The nine zones include: 
Lake Victoria Crescent: This  zone covers areas around Lake  
59
Victoria and experiences a  tropical rainforest climate. It is  characterized by high rainfall  and fertile soils, suitable for  growing crops like bananas,  coffee, tea, and cocoa. 
Central 1: Located in the central  part of the country, this zone  experiences a bimodal rainfall  pattern with two distinct rainy  seasons. It is suitable for growing  
a wide range of crops, including  maize, beans, bananas, and  coffee. 
Central 2: Like Central 1, this  zone also experiences a bimodal  rainfall pattern. It is suitable for  growing crops like maize, beans,  bananas, and coffee. 
Eastern: This zone covers the  eastern part of Uganda and  
NATIONAL UNITY PLATFORM | 2026 
experiences a bimodal rainfall  pattern. It is suitable for growing  crops like maize, millet, sorghum,  and beans. 
West Nile: Located in the north western part of the country, this  zone experiences a unimodal  rainfall pattern with a single rainy  season. It is suitable for growing  crops like maize, sorghum, millet,  and groundnuts. 
North-East: This zone covers the  north-eastern part of Uganda  and experiences a semi-arid  climate with low and unreliable  rainfall. It is suitable for growing  drought-resistant crops like  sorghum, millet, and groundnuts. 
Western: This zone covers the  western part of Uganda and  experiences a bimodal rainfall  pattern. It is suitable for growing  crops like bananas, coffee, tea,  maize, and beans. 
South-West: This zone covers the  south-western part of Uganda  and experiences a bimodal  rainfall pattern. It is suitable for  growing crops like bananas,  coffee, tea, maize, and beans. 
Northern: This zone covers the  northern part of Uganda and  experiences a unimodal rainfall  pattern with a single rainy  season. It is suitable for growing  crops like sorghum, millet, and  groundnuts. 
“Economic growth and poverty  move with the fortunes of  Uganda’s agriculture sector,  which, in turn, depends on the  whims of the weather. Farmers  will not invest in commercial  agriculture while counterfeit and  
poor-quality inputs dominate the  market. They need to be able  trust the distribution system and  have tenure security and access  to finance. This requires effective  policies and regulations, and  that politics steers clear of the  agriculture sector”.-Christina  Malmberg Calvo, World Bank  Country Manager for Uganda. 
SITUATION  
ANALYSIS:  
UNLOCKING  
UGANDA’S  
AGRICULTURAL  POTENTIAL LAND  & CULTIVATION 
Uganda is richly endowed with  arable land—about 80% of the  country is suitable for farming— but only 35% of this land is  currently under cultivation.  This means that two-thirds of  potentially productive land lies  dormant, waiting to be activated.  The production of some key  crops and their value, however,  has been growing over the years. 
Official figures indicate that  maize production has surged  from 3.4 million MT in 2018 to  5 million MT in 2024, reflecting  increased farmer activity. Maize  exports have correspondingly  grown, rising from $63.5 million  (FY 2018/19) to $195.3 million (FY  2023/24) —a strong indicator  that Uganda is scaling up  commercial production.  Coffee is leading export valued  at $1.14 billion (FY 2023/24).  Agriculture accounted for 24% of  GDP and 35% of export earnings  in FY 2022/23 
60
MANIFESTO 
While agricultural output has  increased, productivity is still  heavily grounded in nature and  tradition. Farming remains rain 
fed, mechanization is minimal,  and many farmers rely on  outdated tools and low-yield  seed varieties. Only about 10% of  commercial farms use irrigation,  leaving yields vulnerable to  rainfall variability. Mechanization  levels are low, and market links  remain underdeveloped— resulting in wasted opportunities  and poor profitability. 
Despite the capacity of Uganda’s  arable land to feed 200 million  people per year, according to  Uganda Agri-Economic Outlook  2024, Uganda continues to  face serious food-insecurity  issues. According to the recently  released Uganda Census 2024  report, majority (57%) of 48 million  Ugandans are food insecure. 
The Integrated Food Security  Phase Classification (IPC)  indicates that 2.3 million  Ugandans are in full food crisis,  11.9 million (26%) are under  high stress, and 31.7 million  (69%) experience minimal food  insecurity. 
61

Fisheries & Aquaculture: A  Growth Frontier 
Fisheries contribute  at least 12% of  
agricultural  
GDP, supporting  approximately 3.2  million fishers and  their families. 
Uganda has for long relied on its  Capture fisheries, supported by  its major lakes including Victoria,  Kyoga and Albert. However,  production has declined— 
exports fell by nearly 28%  (from 28,861 tonnes in 2023 to  20,818 tonnes in 2024) and export  revenues dropped by 22% (from  UGX 514.5 bn to UGX 395.7 bn).  This sub-sector is threatened  by overfishing, the use of illegal  fishing gear which capture  premature fish, and weaknesses  in law enforcement. 
Aquaculture production has  increased in the recent past,  from 800 t (2000) to 120,000 t  (2018). According to the World  Aquaculture Society, in 2021  Uganda produced 139,000 t,  representing approximately 6%  of Africa’s aquaculture output,  placing it third after Egypt (~68%)  and Nigeria (12%). 
There is a lot of room for  growth for the fisheries sector  with enforcement of laws and  boosting aquaculture. 
Fruits and vegetables 
NATIONAL UNITY PLATFORM | 2026 
30% to 52%. The reason for low  uptake is tagged on the high  
The combined market for  vegetables in Eastern Africa is  expected to be US $21.7 billion  in 2024, according to Statista,  with a projected growth rate  of 12.6% annually. Similarly, the  fresh fruits market in the region  is estimated at US $15.6 billion in  2024, growing at 11.5% annually. 
Access to Seeds and seeds  production 
National Agriculture and  Research Organisation (NARO)  is responsible for production of  improved crop varieties that  stimulate high yields for both  household consumption and  commercialization. To date  NARO has produced over 20  licensed varieties of crops  including maize, beans, soya  beans, Sorghum, rice among  others. According to the study by  NARO, the seed yield of a hybrid  is higher and so more income  and profit. 
Yet according to another  assessment undertaken by  NARO on the bean and maize  varieties released over the years  revealed that the uptake rate for  bean was below 20% while that  of maize only ranged between  
cost of these improved varieties. 
At least 8 out 10 farmers say the  hybrid is better than the local  but it is too expensive for them.  They prefer low yield seeds at  3000 a kg instead of buying at  8000 to 10,000 a kg for a hybrid.  If the cost can go as low as by  50%. It could help boost uptake.  This could explain why many of  our farmers especially in rural  setup produce not beyond their  household level/subsistence. 
In terms of budget allocations,  NARO and its institutions  were allocated Shs116 billion  in FY2022/2023 as compared  to Shs.1trillion to NRM’s PDM  program allocated to parishes  annually ~ with most this money  misappropriated by the fund  administrators. 
Livestock & Dairy 
Uganda’s livestock sector  contributes about 5–8% of the  national GDP and employing  over 30% of the agricultural labor  force (FAO, 2022). The sector  includes a diverse population  of cattle, goats, sheep, pigs,  and poultry, which support  both subsistence farmers and  commercial enterprises. 
62
MANIFESTO 

Cattle: Uganda has  approximately 17 million cattle  (UBOS, 2023), mainly indigenous  breeds used for both meat and  dairy. The dairy sub-sector is  growing, supplying domestic  milk and dairy products, but  faces challenges such as low  productivity, poor animal health  services, and limited access to  quality feed (FAO, 2021). 
Goats and Sheep: These small  ruminants are important for rural  livelihoods, especially in semi arid and pastoral areas. Uganda  has an estimated 15 million goats  and sheep combined, which are  crucial for meat production and  serve as a source of income and  food security (ILRI, 2020). 
Pigs and Poultry: The pig  population is growing, estimated  at over 4 million, and poultry  farming is widespread, mostly  smallholder and backyard  systems, providing meat and  eggs for local consumption  (UBOS, 2023). 
63
The livestock sector has strong  growth potential. Increased  investment in improved breeds,  veterinary services, feed supply,  and market infrastructure could  significantly boost productivity  and income for farmers. There  is a regional meat and dairy  products markets, mainly  to neighboring East African  countries. But value addition and  cold chain infrastructure must be  developed to tap into this market. 
Value Addition & Agro Processing 
Uganda’s food-processing  sector already accounts for  approximately 60% of the  country’s total manufacturing  output, according to the Uganda  Manufacturers Association  and UNDP. In 2020, the food  sales market was valued at  around USD 10.5 billion, and  it was projected to jumped to  USD 16 billion by 2024, driven by  rapid urbanization, a growing  population, rising incomes, and  
increasing consumer demand  for processed and packaged 
foods. This growth trajectory  signals enormous potential  not only for value addition and  agro-industrial expansion but  also for job creation and rural  transformation. 
Water for production 
Uganda’s irrigation potential  totals approximately 3.03  million hectares, but only 0.5%  (roughly 15,000 ha) is currently  cultivated under irrigation  (National Irrigation Policy 2018).  Additionally, just 2% of farms  in Uganda use any form of  irrigation, with only 1% being  formally irrigated (IFPI 2024).  This reflects the extremely low  use of productive water systems  in Uganda’s agriculture sector,  underscoring a significant  opportunity for expansion.  Hindrances to irrigation include  the cost of procuring the  necessary equipment, lack of  access to reliable water sources  for farmers, lack of technical  support, major policy gaps,  and lack of political goodwill to  support irrigation by the NRM  government. 
Conclusion 
Uganda holds immense  agricultural promise—fertile  land, freshwater abundance,  and a climate that supports  year-round production. Yet, this  potential remains underutilized  due to fragmented land use,  outdated farming methods, poor  irrigation, and underinvestment  in agro-industrial transformation  
Our  
Promise  
NATIONAL UNITY PLATFORM | 2026 
from providing services to school  feeding programs, and local  communities and our country  stands to benefit from better  

and unwilling NRM government.  With 80% arable land and  the capacity to feed over 200  million people annually, Uganda  must now decisively shift from  subsistence to commercial  agriculture. This means  modernizing irrigation, investing  in aquaculture and enforcing  fisheries regulation, boosting  livestock productivity, and  building robust agro-processing  value chains. To drive inclusive  growth and food security,  strategic investment in water for  production and value addition  must move from rhetoric. 
for a new  Uganda  Now 
6.1 Working with Parents  Teachers Associations to  establish a school feeding  program. 
We are committed to establishing  a Home-Grown School Feeding  Program that will provide hot  meals to primary school pupils in  public schools. The food will be  sourced locally from smallholder  farmers by the empowered  Parents Teachers Association,  coordinated by the Community  Development Office in every  district. 
This commitment aims to  address the longstanding issue  of hungry learners, which hinders  their ability to concentrate and  learn effectively. This is expected  to boost enrollment, enhance  learning experience and  ultimately raise completion rates. 
We are committed to investing in  our Home Grown School feeding  is motivated by the expected  short, medium- and long-term  benefits to our economy. When  food is purchased locally, farmers  benefit from enhanced access  to more stable markets, women  - especially those small and  medium-sized businesses benefit  
human capital and improved  socio-economic development. 
Our school feeding is an inter sectoral program that brings into  play the education, agriculture,  heath, trade and rural  development sectors to interact  and benefit one another. Every  one of us will have a role to play  in school feeding. 
6.2 Re-establish farmer  cooperatives 
We will re-establish and  modernise farmer cooperatives  as engines of agricultural  transformation and rural  prosperity. These cooperatives  will give smallholder farmers  collective power to access  affordable credit, quality inputs,  modern machinery, and fair  markets.

SECURE LAND RIGHTS  FOR ALL. 
INTRODUCTION: 
The existence of Ugandans  depends majorly on land. Despite  managing this land for a long  time, Many Ugandans generally  do not have documented or  recognized rights. Despite  customary land being the biggest  share of land tenure system in  Uganda, the NRM government  has not recognized legitimate  customary rights: Land grabbing  is widespread. About 33 million  people around the world have  lost their livelihoods through  systematic violation of land  rights by large foreign investors  and influential national actors.  Research indicates that Land  grabbing occurs mostly in  countries with dysfunctional and  corrupt governments. Without  arable land, small farmers  cannot produce any food, and  fair compensation, jobs, and  appropriate wages for hard work  on the new plantations turn out  to be empty promises. 
All over the world Land has been  known to be vital aspect of human  life since all humanity de-pends on  it for its existence. Land is what  describes people as a community,  gives them a live hood and is a  source of food and income when  used for agri-cul-ture and other  purposes of de-vel-op-ment. Glob ally, es-pe-cially in African coun 
tries there is in-creas-ing need for  agri-cul-tural land that will sus-tain  food pro-duc-tion to cover the food  in-se-cu-ri-ties that has caused  land fights. In Uganda, Agriculture  accounts for just under a third  of land use, and the country’s  main exports are coffee, fish, tea,  tobacco and cotton. Some 15% of  the country is covered by forest  (U.S Department of State, 2012).  Society’s fights over land has be come a very normal phe-nom-ena  in an in-creas-ing pop-u-lated to day’s world of Globalization where  cul-ture, eco-nomic and so-cial as

ment, hence vi-o-lat-ing the hu man rights of ex-is-tence of the  lo-cals and right of own-er-ship  of land stip-u-lated in the Ugan dan con-sti-tu-tion.

Po-lit-i-cal elites have acted as  an um-brella for these land grab bers hence mak-ing many Ugan dan com-mu-ni-ties to suf-fer not  only due to lit-tle or lack of knowl edge in re-gards to their rights  but also be-cause the laws and  poli-cies in mostly African coun tries does not cater for pro-tec tion and reser-va-tion of these  rights.

Sto-ries of land evic-tions, land  grab-bing and en-croach-ment  of farm lands, forests, wa-ter  bod-ies and dis-cov-ered ar 
eas of oil and other valu-able  min-er-als are every-where. Few  in-dividu-als voices have been  able to sur-pass in-tim-i-da-tion  and open up through me-dia or  by pe-ti-tion-ing parliament. But  there are also those in-di-vid-u 
als who still face intimi-da-tion  hence hin-der-ing their voices to  be heard. 
Par-lia-ment through its com-mit tee of physical in-fra-struc-ture  has been presented with over  40 pending petitions on irregular  allo-ca-tion of Land from both  multinational in-vestors and  government and encroachments

in the name of development that  have been pil-ing over the years.  In Uganda, estimates suggest  between 4 and 8 per cent of  land is under foreign land deals  (GRAIN, 2011a). 
The rules and laws guid-ing  own-er-ship of land is not  well stipulated and its be ing manipulated by the few  powerful elites and for-eign ers- this con-tin-ues to be a sad  occurrence in Uganda. Although  rural communities’ customary  land rights are protected under  the Ugandan constitution, in  practice, these rights are being  violated. As a result, communities  are being 
displaced and losing vital access  to natural resources, including  land for farming, firewood, forest  products and in some places,  water supplies. 
In Uganda, the Government, keen  to attract foreign investment, has  allowed foreign companies to  move onto large areas of land for  a range of projects, including the  development of a large-scale oil  palm plantations, carbon offset  tree plantations and following  the recent discovery of oil, for  drilling. Culturally important  sites have been destroyed and  local traditions and customs are  being lost as the local population  migrates and diversifies. Forests  have been cleared to make way  for the plantations and wetlands  have been drained, damaging  the rich natural biodiversity. 
The reduction in local food  supply has meant more food  has to be imported to the island,  
leading to increased food prices.  As the plantation only offers low  paid casual work, local people  struggle to make ends meet. As  a result there is a greater risk of  food insecurity. 
In the oil rich Albertine region,  local communities are losing  their land to oil companies  and land speculators. The tree  plantations being developed to  seek carbon credits are replacing  native forest with monoculture  plantations of non-native species  such as eucalyptus and pine.  Land conflicts and intertribal / ethnic crashes have occurred in  some communities where land  grabbing has occurred. 
Land grabbing  
in Uganda is  
intensifying  
and spreading  
throughout the  
country. 
The development of industrial  scale agriculture projects to  supply global commodity  markets is depriving local  communities of access to natural  resources, exacerbating rural  poverty and aggravating the risk  of food crises. 
Action is needed to support the  development of small-scale,  agro-ecological local agriculture  projects, which allow local  people to grow food for their  communities and improve local  food security.
